the	O

Part	O
of	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
the	O
tendency	O
of	O
all	O

ever	O
since	O
the	O
didactic	O
days	O
of	O
Norman	O

,	O
to	O
preach	O
about	O
social	O
issues	O

To	O
some	O
extent	O
,	O
this	O
tendency	O
emerges	O
whenever	O
the	O
show	O
tries	O
to	O
enlighten	O
us	O
about	O
ethnic	O
stereotypes	O
by	O
reversing	O
them	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
Michael	O
dislikes	O
Jackie	O
not	O
because	O
he	O
'	O
s	O
a	O
shrewd	O
Jewish	O

because	O
he	O
quits	O

a	O
salesman	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
become	O
a	O
social	O
worker	O

Even	O
more	O
problematic	O
is	O
the	O
incompatibility	O
between	O
sitcom	O
preachiness	O
and	O
Mr	O

Mason	O
'	O
s	O
comic	O

moments	O

the	O
end	O
-LRB-	O
and	O
occasionally	O
in	O
the	O

when	O
Mr	O

slips	O
into	O
his	O

Jewish	O

as	O
to	O

But	O
too	O
often	O

this	O

A	O
quarter	O

Those	O

the	O

suspect	O
today	O
that	O
an	O

Choice	O
of	O
the	O

seemed	O
to	O
doom	O

as	O
the	O

the	O

the	O
