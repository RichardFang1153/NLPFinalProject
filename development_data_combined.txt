9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>chose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Allday </ENAMEX>, a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend </ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>, to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission </ENAMEX>. 
137 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allday </ENAMEX>would succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Hesse </ENAMEX>, who is resigning . 
194 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House </ENAMEX>said Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hesse </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businesswoman </ENAMEX>who previously held posts at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Energy Department </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FERC </ENAMEX>, is leaving to become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Chicago Corp .  
374 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allday </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Midland </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>, has been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solicitor </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Interior Department </ENAMEX>. 
464 He met Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1950s </TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>was a young oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Midland </ENAMEX>and Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allday </ENAMEX>was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer </ENAMEX>for an oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>. 
591 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FERC </ENAMEX>is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>- member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission </ENAMEX>that regulates <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars </NUMEX>of interstate wholesale energy transactions . 
708 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allday </ENAMEX>' s appointment is subject to confirmation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>. 
775 Administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>said a date for Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hesse </ENAMEX>' s departure has n't been set .  

9 Right away you notice the following things about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Glass </ENAMEX>concert . 
82 It attracts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>with funny hair -LRB- or with no hair - - in front of me a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl </ENAMEX>with spiked locks sat beside a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy </ENAMEX>who had shaved his -RRB- . 
215 Whoever constitute the local <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Left Bank </ENAMEX>come out in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force </ENAMEX>, dressed in black , along with a smattering of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies </ENAMEX>who want to be on the cutting edge . 
362 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses </ENAMEX>tend to look stoned . 
406 And , if still conscious at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening </TIMEX>' s end , you notice something else : The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience </ENAMEX>, at first entranced and hypnotized by the music , releases its pent - up feelings in collective gratitude . 
598 Currently in the middle of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four - week </TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 </NUMEX>- city tour as a solo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pianist </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX>has left behind his synthesizers , equipment and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collaborators </ENAMEX>in favor of going it alone . 
770 He sits down at the piano and plays . 
807 And plays . 
818 Either one likes it or one does n't . 
854 The typical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience </ENAMEX>, which is more likely to be composed of music <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students </ENAMEX>than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers </ENAMEX>, certainly does . 
975 The work , though , sounds like Muzak for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">spaceships </ENAMEX>. 
1027 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Glass </ENAMEX>is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor </ENAMEX>, and his music the new clothes , of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant - garde </ENAMEX>. 
1107 His success is easy to understand . 
1142 Softly introducing and explaining his pieces , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX>looks and sounds more like a shaggy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet </ENAMEX>describing his work than a classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pianist </ENAMEX>playing a recital . 
1303 The piano compositions , which have been labeled variously as minimalist , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Oriental </ENAMEX>, repetitive , cyclical , monophonic and hypnotic , are relentlessly tonal -LRB- therefore unthreatening -RRB- , unvaryingly rhythmic -LRB- therefore soporific -RRB- , and unflaggingly harmonious but unmelodic -LRB- therefore both pretty and unconventional -RRB- . 
1613 It is music for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>who want to hear something different but do n't want to work especially hard at the task . 
1725 It is E - Z listening for the now generation . 
1771 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX>has inverted the famous modernist dictum ` less is more . ' 
1838 His more is always less . 
1863 Far from being minimalist , the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised in the simplicities of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 \/ 4 </NUMEX>time , octave intervals , and ragtime or gospel chord progressions . 
2067 But the music has its charm , and Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX>has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex . 
2200 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Opening </ENAMEX>' -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981 </TIMEX>-RRB- , from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Glassworks </ENAMEX>, introduces the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX>technique : Never straying too far from the piano ' s center , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX>works in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>octaves on either side of middle C , and his fingers seldom leave the keys . 
2433 There is a recognizable musical style here , but not a particular performance style . 
2517 The music is not especially pianistic ; indeed , it ' s hard to imagine a bad performance of it . 
2610 Nothing bravura , no arpeggios , no ticklish fingering problems challenge the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performer </ENAMEX>. 
2697 We hear , we may think , inner voices , but they all seem to be saying the same thing . 
2783 With ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Planet News </ENAMEX>, ' music meant to accompany readings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Ginsberg </ENAMEX>' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Wichita Vortex Sutra </ENAMEX>, ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX>gets going . 
2903 His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard . 
2948 <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Seventh </NUMEX>chords make you feel as though he may break into a -LRB- very slow -RRB- improvisatory riff . 
3039 The chords modulate , but there is little filigree even though his fingers begin to wander over more of the keys . 
3152 Contrasts predictably accumulate : <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First </NUMEX>the music is loud , then it becomes soft , then -LRB- you realize -RRB- it becomes louder again . 
3277 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">The Fourth Knee Play </ENAMEX>, ' an interlude from ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Einstein on the Beach </ENAMEX>, ' is like a toccata but it does n't seem to move much beyond its left - hand ground in ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Three Blind Mice </ENAMEX>. ' 
3448 When Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX>decides to get really fancy , he crosses his hands and hits a resonant bass note with his right hand . 
3564 He does this in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three </NUMEX>of his solo pieces . 
3615 You might call it a leitmotif or a virtuoso accomplishment . 
3675 In ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Mad Rush </ENAMEX>, ' which came from a commission to write a piece of indeterminate length -LRB- Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX>charmingly , and tellingly , confessed that ` this was no problem for me ' -RRB- , an A section alternates with a B section several times before the piece ends unresolved . 
3935 Not only is the typical Glasswork open - ended , it is also often multiple in its context -LRB- s -RRB- . 
4026 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Mad Rush </ENAMEX>' began its life as the accompaniment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dalai Lama </ENAMEX>' s first public address in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>, when Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX>played it on the organ at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Cathedral of St . John the Divine </ENAMEX>. 
4213 Later it was performed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Bremen </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany </ENAMEX>, and then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucinda Childs </ENAMEX>took it for one of her dance pieces . 
4325 The point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything . 
4411 <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The evening </TIMEX>ended with Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX>' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Metamorphosis </ENAMEX>, ' another multiple work . 
4486 Parts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 </NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 </NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 </NUMEX>come from the soundtrack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Errol Morris </ENAMEX>' s acclaimed film , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Thin Blue Line </ENAMEX>, ' and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>other parts from incidental music to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>separate dramatizations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kafka </ENAMEX>story of the same name . 
4699 When used as background in this way , the music has an appropriate eeriness , as when a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>- note phrase , a descending minor <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX>, accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports , interviews and confessions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris </ENAMEX>film . 
4941 Served up as a solo , however , the music lacks the resonance provided by a context within another medium . 
5048 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Admirers </ENAMEX>of Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX>may agree with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Kostelanetz </ENAMEX>' s sense that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974 </TIMEX>` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Music in Twelve Parts </ENAMEX>' is as encyclopedic and weighty as ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Well - Tempered Clavier </ENAMEX>. ' 
5225 But while making the obvious point that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers </ENAMEX>develop variations from themes , this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass </ENAMEX>' s music . 
5394 Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>yearn for the astringency of neoclassical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stravinsky </ENAMEX>, the genuinely radical minimalism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berg </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webern </ENAMEX>, and what in retrospect even seems like concision in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahler </ENAMEX>. 
5631 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spiegelman </ENAMEX>is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor </ENAMEX>of English at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Southern Methodist University </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southwest Review </ENAMEX>.  

9 An <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now </TIMEX>is standing trial in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia </ENAMEX>. 
66 This is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over in the expectation that it ' s going to hold an election . 
187 The most likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner </ENAMEX>will be the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Marxist </ENAMEX>- dominated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">SWAPO </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels </ENAMEX>. 
254 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist </ENAMEX>' s ` crime ' was writing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">commission </ENAMEX>charged with overseeing the election ' s fairness , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryan O ' Linn </ENAMEX>, was openly sympathetic to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">SWAPO </ENAMEX>. 
424 Shortly after that , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O ' Linn </ENAMEX>had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Stanley </ENAMEX>arrested and his passport confiscated . 
512 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley </ENAMEX>is on trial over charges that he violated a proclamation , issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South African </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator general </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year </TIMEX>, which made it a crime punishable by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years </TIMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison </ENAMEX>for any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person </ENAMEX>to ` insult , disparate or belittle ' the election <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">commission </ENAMEX>. 
784 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley </ENAMEX>affair does n't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia </ENAMEX>when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">SWAPO </ENAMEX>starts running the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>. 
925 To the extent Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley </ENAMEX>has done anything wrong , it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals </ENAMEX>that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Namibian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guerrillas </ENAMEX>were above all else the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims </ENAMEX>of suppression by neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa </ENAMEX>. 
1156 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">SWAPO </ENAMEX>has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . N . General Assembly </ENAMEX>declared it the ` sole , authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">representative </ENAMEX>' of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>in 
1319 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>brokered a peace settlement to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cuba </ENAMEX>' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Afrika Korps </ENAMEX>' from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Angola </ENAMEX>and hold ` free and fair ' elections that would end <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa </ENAMEX>' s control of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia </ENAMEX>. 
1496 The elections are set for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov . 7 </TIMEX>. 
1530 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Press International </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D . C . </ENAMEX>- based conservative wire service , visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia </ENAMEX>to report on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . N . </ENAMEX>- monitored election campaign . 
1710 He interviewed Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O ' Linn </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission </ENAMEX>charged with investigating electoral intimidation , and reported that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O ' Linn </ENAMEX>was openly sympathetic to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">SWAPO </ENAMEX>and indeed had defended its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>. 
1916 After Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley </ENAMEX>' s article was published in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Namibian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O ' Linn </ENAMEX>had criminal charges brought against their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publisher </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer </ENAMEX>. 
2071 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley </ENAMEX>was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month </TIMEX>. 
2172 Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press </ENAMEX>have protested Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley </ENAMEX>' s detention . 
2289 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley </ENAMEX>' s arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to derail <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia </ENAMEX>' s elections . 
2394 Both <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South African </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">SWAPO </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists </ENAMEX>are intimidating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters </ENAMEX>. 
2459 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results . 
2567 It now has the chance to redress that record in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia </ENAMEX>. 
2624 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State </ENAMEX>and the human - rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community </ENAMEX>should insist that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley </ENAMEX>and his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants </ENAMEX>be released and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">United Nation </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitors </ENAMEX>make certain that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O ' Linn </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission </ENAMEX>investigates election complaints from all sides .

1292 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>had losses for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years </TIMEX>before turning profitable in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1988 </TIMEX>. 
1375 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ended Jan . 31 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pace </ENAMEX>rang up profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 . 4 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">72 cents </NUMEX>a share , after a tax - loss carry - forward , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 3 billion </NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>expect its results to continue to improve . 
1576 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>turned the corner fairly recently in profitability , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margo McGlade </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc . </ENAMEX>, who had been forecasting a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46 % </NUMEX>jump in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pace </ENAMEX>' s net income from operations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>and another <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42 % </NUMEX>increase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>. 
1801 ` Warehouse productivity is really beginning to take off . ' 
1861 But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>contend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart </ENAMEX>has agreed to pay too much for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pace </ENAMEX>. 
1931 ` Even if you look at it as a turnaround situation , it ' s expensive , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne Hood </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential - Bache Securities Inc .  
2051 ` In my opinion , you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">player </ENAMEX>in the industry . ' 
2162 Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGlade </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber </ENAMEX>raised a more fundamental question about the deal . 
2240 ` If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart </ENAMEX>ca n't get its act together in discounting , why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets ? ' 
2357 She said , ` I would say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart </ENAMEX>' s number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>job is to address its market - share loss -LCB- in discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores </ENAMEX>-RCB- , which longer - term will lead to improved profit margins . 
2518 At that point , perhaps diversification would be appropriate . ' 
2582 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart </ENAMEX>' s Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonini </ENAMEX>is intent on pushing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>into new retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses </ENAMEX>. 
2669 For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart </ENAMEX>is opening big food and general merchandise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores </ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">hypermarkets </ENAMEX>, and warehouse - type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores </ENAMEX>specializing in office products and sporting goods . 
2841 It also operates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waldenbooks </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pay Less Drug Stores </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Builders Square </ENAMEX>home improvement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores </ENAMEX>. 
2939 In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart </ENAMEX>closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36 </NUMEX>a share , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 . 5 cents </NUMEX>. 
3047 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pace </ENAMEX>rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 625 </NUMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 22 . 125 </NUMEX>a share in national over - the - counter trading . 
3132 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said the acquisition would be financed with short - term borrowings . 
3220 Under terms of the agreement , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>will soon make a tender offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pace </ENAMEX>shares . 
3317 Among the conditions of the offer is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pace </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>tender a majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s shares outstanding . 
3432 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pace </ENAMEX>would ill continue to operate under its present management .  

9 We ' re about to see if advertising works . 
52 Hard on the heels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 </NUMEX>- point stock - market plunge and the uncertainty that ' s followed , a few big brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market ' s just fine . 
273 Their mission is to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>from fleeing the market , as individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>did in droves after the crash in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October   </TIMEX>
398 Just days after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash , major brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>rushed out ads to calm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>. 
486 This time around , they ' re moving even faster . 
534 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc . </ENAMEX>filmed a new television commercial at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 p . m . EDT </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>and had it on the air by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night </TIMEX>. 
647 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity Investments </ENAMEX>placed new ads in newspapers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, and wrote another new ad appearing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. 
750 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </ENAMEX>by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>had already written new TV ads . 
833 It considered running them during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night </TIMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series </ENAMEX>broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
963 Other brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, were plotting out potential new ad strategies . 
1066 The brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic . 
1207 This time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>were ready . 
1240 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>, for example , prepared ads <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several months ago </TIMEX>in case of a market plunge . 
1323 When the market went into its free fall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>, the investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>ordered full pages in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>editions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>. 
1471 The ads touted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>' s automated <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">800 </ENAMEX>- number beneath the huge headline , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call </ENAMEX>. ' 
1582 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>says the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">800 </ENAMEX>- line , which already was operating but which many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>did n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>. 
1758 ` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , ' he says . 
1845 ` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial . 
1895 It would have been too late to think about on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
1949 We had to think about it ahead of time . ' 
1992 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today </TIMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>ad goes a step further , encouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>to stay in the market or even to plunge in with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>. 
2113 Underneath the headline ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Diversification </ENAMEX>, ' it counsels , ` Based on the events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past week </TIMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market ' s volatility . ' 
2320 It goes on to plug a few diversified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>funds by name . 
2383 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber </ENAMEX>also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash . 
2454 In the aftermath of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>debacle , the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>began taping commercials in - house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that night </TIMEX>. 
2673 It also negotiated an arrangement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cable News Network </ENAMEX>under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>would agree to air its last - minute creations . 
2795 The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber </ENAMEX>commercial , created with ad agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co . </ENAMEX>, features <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Farrell </ENAMEX>, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>' s most visible investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists </ENAMEX>, sounding particularly bullish . 
2982 Taped just as the market closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, it offers Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farrell </ENAMEX>advising , ` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle . . . . 
3132 We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long - term appreciation . ' 
3228 The spot was scheduled to appear <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>times on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night </TIMEX>. 
3294 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber </ENAMEX>considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks . 
3368 Instead , it settled on just urging the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market . 
3472 ` We ' re saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lampe </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of advertising . 
3671 ` If you owned it and liked it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, the true value has n't changed . ' 
3741 He adds , ` This is n't <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>revisited . ' 
3781 With the market fluctuating and then closing up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 88 </NUMEX>points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>had to constantly revise their approach . 
3918 At Shearson Lehman , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>created potential new commercials <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night </TIMEX>and throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>, then had to regroup <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>. 
4065 The plan had been to make one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson </ENAMEX>' s easy - to - film , black - and - white ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Where We Stand </ENAMEX>' commercials , which have been running occasionally in response to news events since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985 </TIMEX>. 
4245 The ad would have run during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series </ENAMEX>tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson </ENAMEX>' s new ad campaign , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Leadership by Example </ENAMEX>. ' 
4390 But in a meeting after the market closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>decided not to go ahead with the stock - market ad . 
4512 ` We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said . 
4569 The market seems to be straightening out ; we ' re taking a wait - and - see attitude , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathleen B . Stewart </ENAMEX>, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC"> vice president </ENAMEX> of marketing . 
4717 In any case , the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>. 
4829 But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective . 
4901 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals </ENAMEX>ran from the market en masse . 
5018 Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around . 
5110 Ad Notes . . . . 
5128 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ARNOLD ADVERTISING </ENAMEX>: 
5148 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Eskandarian </ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Della Femina , McNamee WCRS </ENAMEX>\/ <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston </ENAMEX>, reached an agreement in principle to acquire a majority stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arnold Advertising </ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shop </ENAMEX>. 
5328 Terms were n't disclosed . 
5353 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eskandarian </ENAMEX>, who resigned his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Della Femina </ENAMEX>post in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>, becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>of Arnold . 
5467 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Verret </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>, will retain the title of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>. 
5560 Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald ' s Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oak Brook </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill . </ENAMEX>, named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arnold </ENAMEX>to handle its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">estimated $ 4 million </NUMEX>cooperative ad account for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hartford </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn . </ENAMEX>, area . 
5709 That account had been handled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Della Femina , McNamee WCRS .  
5772 EDUCATION ADS : 
5787 A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">142 </NUMEX>- page ad supplement to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business Week </ENAMEX>' s special ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Corporate Elite </ENAMEX>' issue calls on business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>to use their clout to help solve the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s education crisis . 
5953 The supplement , the largest ever for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>, includes ads from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 </NUMEX>corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>and kicks off a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two - year </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business Week </ENAMEX>initiative on education . 
6111 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>will distribute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers </ENAMEX>.  

9 What does n't belong here ? 
37 A . manual typewriters , B . black - and - white snapshots , C . radio adventure shows . 
122 If you guessed black - and - white snapshots , you ' re right . 
178 After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years </TIMEX>of fading into the background , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>- tone photography is coming back . 
260 Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black - and - white photos of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities </ENAMEX>pitching jeans , shoes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">liquor </ENAMEX>. 
387 Portrait <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>accustomed to shooting only in color report a rush to black - and - white portrait orders . 
491 And black - and - white photography <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes </ENAMEX>are crowded with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students </ENAMEX>. 
560 What ' s happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion , home furnishings and cinematography . 
683 On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Seventh Avenue </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers </ENAMEX>have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white . 
812 And classic black - and - white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes , spurred , in part , by the backlash against colorization of old films . 
966 ` The pendulum is swinging back to black and white , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard DeMoulin </ENAMEX>, the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastman Kodak Co . </ENAMEX>' s professional photography <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division </ENAMEX>. 
1122 Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>, sales of black - and - white film had been declining steadily since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s </TIMEX>. 
1218 But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications , sales increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % </NUMEX>, and they are expected to jump at least that much again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
1395 Photographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>are scrambling to tap the resurging market , reviving some black - and - white product lines and developing new ones . 
1531 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak </ENAMEX>, which largely ignored the market for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years </TIMEX>, black - and - white film sales now account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 15 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion </NUMEX>in film and paper sales <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually </TIMEX>, up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago </TIMEX>. 
1732 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Rochester </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . Y . </ENAMEX>, photographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant </ENAMEX>recently began marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">T - Max 3200 </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films . 
1865 Aimed at commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers </ENAMEX>, the film can be used in very low light without sacrificing quality , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Franz </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Photofinishing Newsletter </ENAMEX>. 
2018 Also trying to snare a portion of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion </NUMEX>- a - year industry is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Agfa Corp . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bayer AG </ENAMEX>. 
2118 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Agfa </ENAMEX>recently signed <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Olympic </ENAMEX>gold medalist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florence Griffith - Joyner </ENAMEX>to endorse a new line of black - and - white paper that ' s geared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>and will compete directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak </ENAMEX>' s papers . 
2307 Slated for market by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the year </TIMEX>, the paper ` could have been introduced a long time ago but the market was n't there then , ' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Agfa </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>. 
2464 The biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">beneficiary </ENAMEX>of the black - and - white revival is likely to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Paper Co . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ilford </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division </ENAMEX>, known in the industry for its premium products . 
2627 Sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ilford </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>varieties of black - and - white film <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>are outpacing growth in the overall market , although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>wo n't say by exactly how much . 
2790 ` We hope the trend lasts , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurie DiCara </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ilford </ENAMEX>' s marketing communications <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>. 
2883 Why all the interest ? 
2905 For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers </ENAMEX>who grew up being photographed in color , black and white seems eye - catching and exotic . 
3010 ` It has an archival , almost nostalgic quality to it , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen B . Butler </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of the applied photography <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">department </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Rochester Institute of Technology </ENAMEX>. 
3174 ` You can shift out of reality with black and white , ' he adds . 
3238 Such features have been especially attractive to professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers </ENAMEX>and marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>, who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising . 
3419 Processing of black - and - white commercial film jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 . 7 million </NUMEX>rolls . 
3511 Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gap Inc . </ENAMEX>, whose latest ad campaign features black - and - white shots of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists </ENAMEX>and other well - known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities </ENAMEX>modeling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer </ENAMEX>' s jeans and T - shirts . 
3693 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Crisman </ENAMEX>, the account <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>for the campaign , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gap </ENAMEX>did n't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>. 
3865 ` We wanted to highlight the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual </ENAMEX>, not the environment , ' he says , ` and black and white allows you to do that better than color . ' 
3999 The campaign won a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Cleo </ENAMEX>award as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>' s best ad by a specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer </ENAMEX>. 
4079 Even food products and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">automobiles </ENAMEX>, which have long depended on color , are making the switch . 
4173 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies </ENAMEX>` feel black and white will convey a stronger statement , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc L . Hauser </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer </ENAMEX>who is working on a black - and - white print ad for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stouffer Food Corp . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lean Cuisine </ENAMEX>. 
4370 Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>that are currently using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>- tone ads include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Co . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Epson America Inc .  
4478 Portrait <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>have also latched onto the trend . 
4529 Using black and white , ` we can make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewives </ENAMEX>look like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars </ENAMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Perrin </ENAMEX>. 
4612 His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">On - Broadway Photography </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Portland </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ore . </ENAMEX>, doubled its business <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>and , he says , is booked solid for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next five </TIMEX>. 
4748 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dayna Brunsdon </ENAMEX>, says she spurned a color portrait for black and white because ` it ' s more dramatic . 
4861 I show it to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends </ENAMEX>, and they all say ` wow . 
4909 ' It is n't ordinary like color . ' 
4944 Still , most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>are n't plunking black - and - white film into their cameras to take family snapshots . 
5048 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>big obstacle is that few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">drugstores </ENAMEX>develop the film anymore . 
5114 Typically , it must be mailed to a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">processors </ENAMEX>and may take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week </TIMEX>or more to be processed and returned . 
5230 Black - and - white film costs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>a little less than color film , and processing costs the same . 
5329 But for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">photofinishers </ENAMEX>, developing costs for black - and - white film are higher . 
5409 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>are starting to tackle that problem . 
5461 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ilford </ENAMEX>, for example , recently introduced a black - and - white film that can be processed quickly by color <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">labs </ENAMEX>. 
5570 Intent on wooing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>is also increasing its sponsorship of black - and - white photography classes . 
5687 Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Agfa </ENAMEX>is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">colleges </ENAMEX>, offering free black - and - white film and paper as prizes . 
5834 And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak </ENAMEX>is distributing an instructional video to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">processors </ENAMEX>on how to develop its monochrome film more efficiently . 
5955 Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>are introducing related products . 
6005 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Charles Beseler Co . </ENAMEX>, a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of photographic enlargers , introduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>a complete darkroom starter kit targeted at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen - agers </ENAMEX>who want to process their own black - and - white photographs . 
6205 The kit , which has a suggested retail price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 </NUMEX>and has already become a bestseller , was introduced after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers </ENAMEX>noticed numerous requests from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children </ENAMEX>' s photography equipment . 
6402 ` It seems computers as hobbies have waned , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Brightman </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beseler </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>. 
6516 But some industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers </ENAMEX>believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad . 
6601 They cite the emergence of still electronic photography , more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints . 
6768 ` Black and white has n't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Rochester Institute </ENAMEX>. 
6904 ` The color print <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>is far superior to prints of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 years ago </TIMEX>. 
6970 You ca n't say the same with black and white . ' 
7018 But when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Popular Photography </ENAMEX>, a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers </ENAMEX>, selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 </NUMEX>of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography ' s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">150th </NUMEX>anniversary , all were black and white . 
7223 ` It ' s got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred DeBat </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Professional Photographers of America </ENAMEX>. 
7341 ` That ' s the appeal .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BMA Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kansas City </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mo . </ENAMEX>, said it ' s weighing ` strategic alternatives , ' for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business Men ' s Assurance Co . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>, and is contacting possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers </ENAMEX>of the life and health insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation </ENAMEX>. 
206 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BMA </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said ` runaway medical costs ' have made health insurance ` a significant challenge , ' and margins also have been pinched by changes in the mix of life - insurance products <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>now demand . 
411 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business Men ' s Assurance </ENAMEX>unit represented <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 288 million </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 488 million </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>revenue , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>' s operating income was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 10 million </NUMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>. 
600 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BMA </ENAMEX>' s investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alex . Brown &amp; Sons Inc . </ENAMEX>, has been authorized to contact possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J . P . Morgan &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>swung to a loss in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Corp . </ENAMEX>reported net income more than doubled , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific Corp . </ENAMEX>net rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>. 
164 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J . P . Morgan &amp; Co .  
184 J . P . Morgan , as expected , posted a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 82 billion </NUMEX>net loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>, reflecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>' s decision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>to add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion </NUMEX>to reserves for losses on loans to less - developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>. 
391 The reserve addition placed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Guaranty Trust Co . </ENAMEX>among a few major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>that have covered nearly all their medium and long - term portfolios to less - developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>with reserves . 
600 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">The latest quarter </TIMEX>' s loss equals <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 . 92 </NUMEX>a share . 
648 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year - earlier quarter </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 233 . 6 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 25 </NUMEX>a share . 
727 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George M . Salem </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential - Bache Securities Inc . </ENAMEX>, called the results ` mildly disappointing . ' 
832 Excluding the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion </NUMEX>provision and allowing for the taxes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan </ENAMEX>paid , earnings were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 65 cents </NUMEX>a share , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem </ENAMEX>said . 
963 In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>composite trading yesterday , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan </ENAMEX>climbed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 50 </NUMEX>a share to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44 . 125 </NUMEX>. 
1062 Net interest income sank <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 254 million </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 347 million </NUMEX>. 
1141 The interest rate on short - term funds , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>borrow to finance longer - term loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>, was ` sharply higher , ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan </ENAMEX>said . 
1279 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan </ENAMEX>received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 million </NUMEX>of interest payments on its medium and long - term <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Brazilian </ENAMEX>loans ; had they been accruing interest , net interest income would have been <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 35 million </NUMEX>higher in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan </ENAMEX>said . 
1489 Such loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Argentina </ENAMEX>also remain classified as non - accruing , costing the bank <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million </NUMEX>of interest income in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX>period . 
1624 Income from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources </ENAMEX>other than interest climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 414 million </NUMEX>, reflecting higher corporate - finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities . 
1789 ` These increases were partly offset by lower trading - related ' income , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>said . 
1874 Non - interest expenses grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 496 million </NUMEX>. 
1924 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Corp .  
1937 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Corp . </ENAMEX>' s net income more than doubled in the period , largely because of continued strong performance by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>operations . 
2077 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charlotte </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . C . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said earnings rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 143 . 6 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 45 </NUMEX>a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 58 . 9 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">69 cents </NUMEX>a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
2219 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">The latest quarter </TIMEX>included a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56 . 1 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">59 cents </NUMEX>a share , related to the purchase of the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Texas National Bank </ENAMEX>from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .  
2409 The strong performance , however , contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>' s problem loans , particularly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southeast </ENAMEX>. 
2557 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, nonperforming assets jumped to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 474 . 1 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 43 % </NUMEX>of net loans and leases , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 232 . 8 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 13 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter </TIMEX>. 
2713 Nonperformers totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 230 . 8 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 27 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year - ago third quarter </TIMEX>. 
2791 Included in the increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the most recent quarter </TIMEX>is a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33 million </NUMEX>loan , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>said it ` expects to be fully repaid , with no loss , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early in the fourth quarter </TIMEX>. ' 
2960 The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 % </NUMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southeast </ENAMEX>operations , as well as a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 % </NUMEX>growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign . 
3146 The higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>' s net interest margin in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southeast </ENAMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 . 38 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 . 80 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
3282 In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>composite trading yesterday , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>jumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 50 </NUMEX>a share , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 51 </NUMEX>. 
3359 Results were released after the market closed . 
3408 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Texas National </ENAMEX>, formed from the remnants of of the failed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First RepublicBank Corp . </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas </ENAMEX>, contributed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 76 . 9 million </NUMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>' s bottom line in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>. 
3577 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>said its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>results reflect <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 % </NUMEX>of earnings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation </ENAMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug . 1 </TIMEX>. 
3677 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 1 . 9 billion </NUMEX>in new capital during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>to complete the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Texas </ENAMEX>purchase , and to acquire several small failed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts </ENAMEX>to fill out its regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchise </ENAMEX>. 
3858 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week </TIMEX>, the banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it purchased both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freedom Savings &amp; Loan Association </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tampa </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla . </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">University Federal Savings Association </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Antonio </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 169 . 4 million </NUMEX>. 
4049 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>' s net income climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 310 . 9 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 30 </NUMEX>a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 188 . 2 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 22 </NUMEX>a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
4199 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific Corp .  
4224 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific </ENAMEX>' s earnings growth slowed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX>bank holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>was still able to post a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real - estate and consumer loans . 
4455 Net rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 185 . 1 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 55 </NUMEX>a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 167 . 9 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 47 </NUMEX>a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
4556 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said the gain resulted mainly from a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 54 million </NUMEX>increase in net interest income , reflecting a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 % </NUMEX>increase in real estate loans -LRB- mainly residential -RRB- , and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 % </NUMEX>rise in consumer loans . 
4753 These high - yielding loans in effect replaced some low - yielding assets such as inter - bank loans , which were allowed to decrease . 
4881 As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific </ENAMEX>' s net interest margin fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 13 </NUMEX>basis points , a more mild decrease than some major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>, which have been reporting more sluggish earnings . 
5075 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific </ENAMEX>shares closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44 . 625 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37 . 5 cents </NUMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>composite trading . 
5169 The earnings represent a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 89 % </NUMEX>return on assets for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific </ENAMEX>, and an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 . 9 % </NUMEX>return on equity . 
5272 The loan growth offset continuing real - estate loan losses in the depressed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona </ENAMEX>market . 
5363 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific </ENAMEX>reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 % </NUMEX>increase in net credit losses for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 109 million </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 81 . 9 million </NUMEX>in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - ago </TIMEX>period .

5599 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security </ENAMEX>Pacific ' s loan - loss provision was down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 % </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 . 4 million </NUMEX>, because it added to its foreign - debt reserve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year before </TIMEX>. 
5732 Non - interest income fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>, mainly because of an unusual gain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>from the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>banking operations . 
5872 Non - interest expense grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 4 % </NUMEX>in the period .

57 FAST - FOOD chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains </ENAMEX>, faced with a worsening business slump , are struggling to hatch some new marketing strategies . 
179 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">The Crest Report </ENAMEX>, which tracks consumer purchases , says customer traffic at chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants </ENAMEX>fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter </TIMEX>, while the overall fast - food customer count was down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 % </NUMEX>. 
365 Chicken business is off largely because of more competition from grocery - store convenience <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food </ENAMEX>, home - delivered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pizza </ENAMEX>and other takeout <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">fare </ENAMEX>, says a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for the report , a publication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NPD Group </ENAMEX>, a market research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Port Washington </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N .

1160 And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain </ENAMEX>is testing products that are n't fried , such as ` char - grilled ' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">chicken </ENAMEX>, to try to win health - conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>.

1401 But some fast - food industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>say problems with keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">chicken </ENAMEX>warm and fresh must be solved <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>. 
1511 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>, however , disputed the notion that the delivery service experienced problems in some markets where testing has been discontinued . 
1676 He says the test is continuing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Columbus </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio </ENAMEX>, and a few other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities </ENAMEX>. 
1761 The advertising industry is buzzing with rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken </ENAMEX>will drop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Young &amp; Rubicam </ENAMEX>and seek a new ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency </ENAMEX>. 
1889 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>declines to comment . 
1928 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emanuel Goldman </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>, predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken </ENAMEX>will post an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 % </NUMEX>drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>net income .

2128 Reluctant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Advertisers </ENAMEX>Try Soft - Sell Spots 
2174 CALL IT un - advertising . 
2198 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bear </ENAMEX>is selling a soft approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients </ENAMEX>who want exposure yet shun pushy ads . 
2309 His ploy : <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 - second </TIMEX>radio spots that offer helpful hints . 
2367 The only plug for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sponsor </ENAMEX>is a brief mention at the end of the spot . 
2442 The messages resemble the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business Traveler </ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX>dose of travel tips developed by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bear </ENAMEX>and sponsored by travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies </ENAMEX>in several major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities </ENAMEX>. 
2597 New <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">un - advertisers </ENAMEX>include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burt Hill Kosar Rittlemann Associates </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Butler </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa . </ENAMEX>, architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>. 
2698 Its radio series features such spots as ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Floodlights : Evening Wear for Urban Structures </ENAMEX>' and ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Building a Place to Park . </ENAMEX>' 
2819 A harder sell , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kosar </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>, would ` detract from the profession . ' 
2912 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">Hospitals </ENAMEX>have signed up to use the messages to promote fundraisers , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Equitable Gas Co . </ENAMEX>is considering the format to offer energy tips to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>. 
3066 But such spots can be too soft . 
3098 ` There ' s always a risk of lost messages , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Fitzgerald </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ketchum Advertising USA </ENAMEX>, which created similar radio spots for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pittsburgh National Bank </ENAMEX>. 
3263 ` It ' s a question of how much credibility you gain for the possible loss of recognition . ' 
3354 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Retailer </ENAMEX>Sees Pitfalls In Environmental Push 
3403 HERE ' S a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer </ENAMEX>that ' s getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products . 
3505 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Bear Supermarkets Inc . </ENAMEX>, a grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain </ENAMEX>based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Diego </ENAMEX>, plans to display shelf cards and distribute pamphlets recommending products deemed safe for the environment . 
3678 The choices will be based on research by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">San Diego Environmental Health Coalition </ENAMEX>and will include products like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Murphy ' s Oil Soap </ENAMEX>and other noncorrosive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">cleaners </ENAMEX>. 
3848 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain </ENAMEX>is quickly realizing the pitfalls of such endorsements . 
3918 For example , it recommends nonchlorinated dishwasher <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent </ENAMEX>and puts <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Sunlight </ENAMEX>on its environmentally safe list . 
4035 That does n't thrill <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Procter &amp; Gamble Co . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cascade </ENAMEX>dishwasher <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent </ENAMEX>. 
4116 A company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>questioned the validity of the list , noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chlorine </ENAMEX>is present in all major dishwasher <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergents </ENAMEX>. 
4241 In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lever Bros . </ENAMEX>confirms that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Sunlight </ENAMEX>brand does contain chlorine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bleach </ENAMEX>, even though it is n't listed on the label for the powder version . 
4390 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas G . Dahlen </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Bear </ENAMEX>' s executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain </ENAMEX>is still reviewing its product list to avoid such problems . 
4520 ` Our intent is to promote the best alternative , ' he says . 
4578 ` And it ' s important that we be accurate . ' 
4622 But in the end , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>' wishes are what will prevail . 
4679 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Bear </ENAMEX>does n't care for disposable diapers , which are n't biodegradable . 
4753 Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents </ENAMEX>demand them . 
4778 Says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dahlen </ENAMEX>, ` We ' ll still be forced to sell items we might not philosophically agree with . ' 
4876 Odds and Ends 
4892 NEATNESS does count - - at least in the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store </ENAMEX>. 
4948 A study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Safeway ' s Scanner Marketing Research </ENAMEX>shows soap sales climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % </NUMEX>when bars were neatly stacked on shelves instead of dumped in a wire basket . . . .

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hughes Aircraft Co . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp . </ENAMEX>, said it agreed to purchase the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Electro - Optics Technology </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Perkin - Elmer Corp .  
152 Terms of the agreement were n't disclosed . 
194 But for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal year ended July 31 , 1988 </TIMEX>, the most recent period for which results were broken out , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Perkin - Elmer </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half </NUMEX>the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 145 million </NUMEX>in sales recorded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s government systems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sector </ENAMEX>.

585 In addition to making electro - optical systems , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>also makes laser warning receivers . 
677 These are used aboard military <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">helicopters </ENAMEX>to warn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots </ENAMEX>that a laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapon </ENAMEX>has been focused on them . 
783 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hughes </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PerkinElmer </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>' s work complements efforts by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Electro - Optical and Data Systems </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>, which makes infrared sensors , military <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">lasers </ENAMEX>and night vision equipment . 
979 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hughes </ENAMEX>said it expects the sale to close by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year end </TIMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amcast Industrial Corp . </ENAMEX>said it plans to repurchase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 , 000 </NUMEX>shares , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7 % </NUMEX>of its shares outstanding , in open market transactions . 
145 The metal products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>currently has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 . 2 million </NUMEX>common shares outstanding . 
227 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amcast </ENAMEX>previously had said it planned to repurchase shares , but did n't disclose when or how many shares it intended to buy back . 
356 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dillon Read &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>as its exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agent </ENAMEX>for the stock buy - back program .

158 Literally . 
171 It turns out Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Machelle Parks </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cincinnati </ENAMEX>, did n't like the way defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Alexander </ENAMEX>acted during the legal proceedings . 
322 So she has agreed to forgo monetary damages against Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client </ENAMEX>in return for the right to punch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney </ENAMEX>. 
444 Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother </ENAMEX>also gets to cuff Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander </ENAMEX>. 
496 So does Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend </ENAMEX>and his law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick Nichols </ENAMEX>. 
552 The bizarre arrangement grows out of Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander </ENAMEX>' s representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Derr Construction Co . </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">defendants </ENAMEX>in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow </ENAMEX>of a construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker </ENAMEX>killed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1987 </TIMEX>while working on a new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>convention <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center </ENAMEX>. 
830 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend </ENAMEX>says , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate </ENAMEX>agreed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Derr </ENAMEX>would pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 , 000 </NUMEX>as part of an overall settlement . 
956 But Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander </ENAMEX>scuttled the deal at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last minute </TIMEX>, angering the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiff </ENAMEX>' s side . 
1043 ` I never agreed to it , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander </ENAMEX>says , adding that ` it ' s not necessary to pay these nuisance settlements . ' 
1157 When Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks </ENAMEX>and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother </ENAMEX>heard about what had happened , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend </ENAMEX>says , they volunteered that they would like to give Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander </ENAMEX>a good walloping . 
1313 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend </ENAMEX>says he passed that along to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversary </ENAMEX>, and soon they were talking about the ground rules under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Derr </ENAMEX>could keep its money and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs </ENAMEX>could take a shot at Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander </ENAMEX>. 
1513 Although time and place have yet to be determined , some details are in place . 
1591 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend </ENAMEX>says he agreed to strike Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander </ENAMEX>above the belt . 
1657 Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks </ENAMEX>and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother </ENAMEX>indicated they want to ` catch him unawares from behind , ' he says . 
1748 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander </ENAMEX>, for his part , insisted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">punchers </ENAMEX>ca n't assign their pummeling rights to anyone else , ca n't use a blunt instrument and ca n't take a running start . 
1919 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander </ENAMEX>says he regards the agreement , which has n't been submitted to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge </ENAMEX>, as something of a joke . 
2028 However , he acknowledges they ` have the option of taking a swat at me if they really want to . ' 
2123 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend </ENAMEX>says his side is ` dead serious . ' 
2167 Although they do n't contemplate delivering any disabling blows , he says that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander </ENAMEX>will be asked to sign a release from liability , just in case .

3365 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>joined every <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>except <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Albania </ENAMEX>at the meeting .

3984 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angel Gurria </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico </ENAMEX>' s top debt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiator </ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>' s creditor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>are responding positively to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico </ENAMEX>' s debt - reduction package . 
4126 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gurria </ENAMEX>' s optimism contrasts with some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>' views that the deal may require a lot of arm twisting by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . S . Treasury </ENAMEX>in order to succeed . 
4273 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gurria </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">under - secretary </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministry </ENAMEX>of finance , met <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>, at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>- way point on a so - called road show to market the package around the world . 
4474 An increasing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>appear to be considering the option under the deal whereby they can swap their <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican </ENAMEX>loans for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 - year </TIMEX>bonds with a face value discounted by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 % </NUMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gurria </ENAMEX>said . 
4669 The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>options consist of swapping loans for bonds with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 . 25 % </NUMEX>interest rates , or providing fresh loans . 
4782 The accord , which covers <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 52 . 7 billion </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico </ENAMEX>' s medium - and long - term debt , is expected to go into effect in early

5270 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dalai Lama </ENAMEX>, who was just awarded the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Nobel Peace Prize </ENAMEX>, lives in exile in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India </ENAMEX>.

294 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BSN </ENAMEX>will initially acquire a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % </NUMEX>interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Birkel </ENAMEX>, a closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>. 
371 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>has an agreement giving it the right to buy all the shares outstanding , and this could be completed within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few months </TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BSN </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman </ENAMEX>said .

621 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Birkel </ENAMEX>is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>- biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pasta </ENAMEX>, with sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">250 million marks </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 133 . 4 million </NUMEX>-RRB- in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>.

862 The acquisition strengthens <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BSN </ENAMEX>' s position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX>pasta market . 
935 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>currently ranks <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barilla Group of Italy </ENAMEX>, whose sales are chiefly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian </ENAMEX>market .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Clark </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>, reported for work at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 a . m . </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two and a half hours </TIMEX>before the usual <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning </TIMEX>strategy meeting . 
162 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferies &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J . Francis Palamara </ENAMEX>did n't reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 : 30 a . m . </TIMEX>, but then he had been up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">most of the night </TIMEX>at home . 
294 ` I had calls <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all night </TIMEX>long from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">States </ENAMEX>, ' he said . 
349 ` I was woken up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every hour </TIMEX>- - <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 : 30 </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 : 30 </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 : 30 </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 : 30 </TIMEX>. 
403 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>are looking for possible opportunities to buy , but nobody wants to stick their chin out . ' 
502 For many of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>' s securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>, it was a day that started nervously in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the small hours </TIMEX>. 
599 By lunchtime , the selling was at near - panic fever . 
650 But as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>ended in a frantic Wall Street - inspired rally , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">City </ENAMEX>breathed a sigh of relief . 
750 So it went <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>in the trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rooms </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>' s financial district . 
824 In the wake of Wall Street ' s plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>market was considered especially vulnerable . 
929 And before the opening of trading here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, all eyes were on early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be . 
1075 By the time trading officially got under way at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 a . m . </TIMEX>, the news from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia </ENAMEX>was in . 
1158 And it left mixed signals for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>. 
1196 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>stocks closed off a significant but less - than - alarming <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 8 % </NUMEX>on thin volume ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>stocks declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 . 5 % </NUMEX>in orderly trading . 
1331 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferies </ENAMEX>' trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">room </ENAMEX>on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Finsbury Circus </ENAMEX>, a stately <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">circle </ENAMEX>at the edge of the financial district , desktop computer screens displayed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>market ' s major barometer - - the Financial Times - Stock Exchange 100 Share Index . 
1560 Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks ; blue figures , rising stocks . 
1642 Right away , the reds outnumbered the blues , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 </NUMEX>, as the index opened at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2076 . 8 </NUMEX>, off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">157 . 1 </NUMEX>points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 % </NUMEX>. 
1754 ` I see concern , but I do n't see any panic , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palamara </ENAMEX>, a big , good - humored <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native </ENAMEX>who runs the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 </NUMEX>- trader <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>. 
1886 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferies </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, played it conservatively , seeking to avoid risk . 
1997 ` This is not the sort of market to have a big position in , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Smith </ENAMEX>, who heads trading in all non - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>stocks . 
2117 ` We tend to run a very tight book . ' 
2153 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferies </ENAMEX>spent most of its energies in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning </TIMEX>trying to match <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers </ENAMEX>, and there were n't many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>. 
2274 ` All the takeover stocks - - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scottish &amp; Newcastle </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B . A . T </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DRG </ENAMEX>- - are getting pretty well pasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning </TIMEX>, ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith </ENAMEX>said . 
2400 <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Seconds </TIMEX>later , a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 , 500 </NUMEX>- share ` sell ' order for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scottish &amp; Newcastle </ENAMEX>came in . 
2476 For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX>time in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes </TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>next to Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith </ENAMEX>left the no - smoking area to have a cigarette . 
2583 On the screens , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two </NUMEX>forlorn blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 140 </NUMEX>. 
2705 ` Because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>did n't collapse , let ' s pick up a little stock , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith </ENAMEX>said . 
2784 He targeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 , 500 </NUMEX>shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reuters </ENAMEX>and punched a button to call up on his screen other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>' price quotes . 
2895 The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">845 pence </NUMEX>, -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13 . 27 </NUMEX>-RRB- and Mr . Smith ' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>started putting out feelers . 
3018 But the market sensed a serious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyer </ENAMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a day </TIMEX>dominated by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">850 pence </NUMEX>. 
3137 ` When I want to buy , they run from you - - they keep changing their prices , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith </ENAMEX>said . 
3229 ` It ' s very frustrating . ' 
3254 He temporarily abandoned his search for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reuters </ENAMEX>shares . 
3316 By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time </TIMEX>, it was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 : 30 a . m . </TIMEX>in New York , and Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith </ENAMEX>fielded a call from a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer </ENAMEX>wanting an opinion on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>stock market , which had been having troubles of its own even before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>market break . 
3550 ` Fundamentally dangerous . . . , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith </ENAMEX>said , almost in a whisper , ` . . . . fundamentally weak . . . fairly vulnerable still . . . extremely dangerously poised   . 
3718 we ' re in for a lot of turbulence . . . . ' 
3761 He was right . 
3775 By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>market was in full retreat . 
3825 ` It ' s falling like a stone , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Linger </ENAMEX>, a pit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>who was standing outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London International Financial Futures Exchange </ENAMEX>. 
3964 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only half </NUMEX>the usual lunchtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd </ENAMEX>gathered at the tony <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Corney &amp; Barrow </ENAMEX>wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bar </ENAMEX>on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Old Broad Street </ENAMEX>nearby . 
4074 Conversation was subdued as most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons </ENAMEX>watched the latest market statistics on television . 
4167 At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 : 49 p . m . </TIMEX>, the index hit its low , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2029 . 7 </NUMEX>, off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">204 . 2 </NUMEX>points . 
4233 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>opened the limit down , off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 10 % </NUMEX>if you could calculate the index , which you could n't , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>, said early in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>. 
4397 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain </ENAMEX>is down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>and suspended , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Sweden </ENAMEX>' s down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 % </NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Norway </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 % </NUMEX>. 
4461 This market has been very badly damaged . ' 
4505 As <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 : 30 p . m . </TIMEX>- - Wall Street ' s opening time - - neared , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen </ENAMEX>traded bets on how low the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>market would open . 
4646 In the center of the trading floor , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Streeter </ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues </ENAMEX>scrambled for the telephones as soon as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>market opened - - plummeting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 60 </NUMEX>points in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first few minutes </TIMEX>. 
4856 They saw an opportunity created by the sell - off . 
4905 As Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>dumped American Depositary Receipts in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar PLC </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Streeter </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Ruiz </ENAMEX>bought them to resell in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U .

5046 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors </ENAMEX>here still expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor Co . </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp . </ENAMEX>to bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar </ENAMEX>. 
5134 Suddenly , after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 45 minutes </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>markets rallied . 
5194 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">MMI </ENAMEX>has gone better , ' shouted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 3 : 15 </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>time , as the U .

5342 As Wall Street strengthened , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">room </ENAMEX>went wild . 
5406 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>shouted as their screens posted an ever - narrowing loss on Wall Street . 
5485 Then , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine minutes </TIMEX>later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>. 
5564 ` Rally ! Rally ! Rally ! ' shouted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Rosen </ENAMEX>, selling more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar </ENAMEX>shares . 
5651 ` This is panic buying ! ' 
5677 As the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>market rallied , some wondered whether <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>of worrying and jitters had been worth it . 
5784 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>index closed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2163 . 4 </NUMEX>, its high for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>, off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 . 5 </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 3 . 3 % </NUMEX>.  

9 AN EARTHQUAKE STRUCK <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northern California </ENAMEX>, killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>. 
82 The violent temblor , which lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 15 seconds </TIMEX>and registered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 . 9 </NUMEX>on the Richter scale , also caused the collapse of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">30 - foot </NUMEX>section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge </ENAMEX>and shook <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Candlestick Park </ENAMEX>. 
288 The tremor was centered near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollister </ENAMEX>, southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX>, and was felt <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">as far as 200 miles </NUMEX>away .

3792 It was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven years </TIMEX>that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow </ENAMEX>has n't joined efforts , led by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Moslem </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations </ENAMEX>, to expel <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel </ENAMEX>from the world <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">body </ENAMEX>, and was viewed as a sign of improving <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Israeli </ENAMEX>ties .

4044 Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Sisulu </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">African National Congress </ENAMEX>would n't reject violence as a way to pressure the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South African </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>into concessions that might lead to negotiations over apartheid .

4522 The report by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense Ministry </ENAMEX>also rejected allegations that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>covered up evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waldheim </ENAMEX>' s activities as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German </ENAMEX>army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer </ENAMEX>.

9 When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nucor Corp . </ENAMEX>begins shipping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>from the world ' s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>thin - slab <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month </TIMEX>, it will begin testing the competitive mettle of its giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>. 
172 The new technology , which creates a very thin piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>, radically reduces the costs of making flat - rolled sheets . 
292 An ebullient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Iverson </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nucor </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>eventually will make <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">a ton </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 . 5 man hours </TIMEX>, compared with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four to six man hours </TIMEX>at a conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mill </ENAMEX>. 
481 ` We ' ve had the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russians </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India </ENAMEX>visiting us , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iverson </ENAMEX>beams . 
573 ` Everyone in the world is watching us very closely . ' 
628 Especially his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors </ENAMEX>, the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers </ENAMEX>. 
682 Already , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USX Corp . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armco Inc . </ENAMEX>are studying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nucor </ENAMEX>' s technology to see if they can adopt it . 
777 Says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest </ENAMEX>steel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>: ` It ' s damn worrisome . ' 
869 The once - staid steel industry is about to be turned topsy - turvy by a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990s </TIMEX>technology revolution . 
967 New , efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller , less cash - rich <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>to make steel at a fraction of what Big Steel paid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">decades ago </TIMEX>. 
1127 It also enables minimills finally to get a toehold in the flat - rolled steel market - - the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers </ENAMEX>' largest , most prized , and until now , untouchable , market . 
1296 But such thin - slab technology is only the beginning . 
1349 Eager <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers </ENAMEX>espouse direct - steelmaking and direct casting , which by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the 1990s </TIMEX>will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces . 
1504 Those massive structures , while posing cost and environmental headaches , effectively locked out all but deep - pocketed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants </ENAMEX>from steelmaking . 
1649 ` There ' s a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way we market and distribute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Dennis </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, manufacturing and technology , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Iron Ore and Steel Institute </ENAMEX>. 
1868 It is n't that major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers </ENAMEX>have blithely ignored high technology . 
1939 In fact , they ' ve spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars </NUMEX>to boost the percentage of continously cast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 . 9 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39 . 6 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five years before </TIMEX>. 
2080 Moreover , their balance sheets are rich with diversity , their old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>shuttered , and work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces </ENAMEX>lean . 
2188 But that wo n't suffice . 
2212 ` It ' s no longer enough to beat the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy </ENAMEX>down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street </ENAMEX>. 
2268 You have to beat everyone around the world , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis </ENAMEX>. 
2330 He wants to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers </ENAMEX>more involved in computers and artificial intelligence . 
2416 The problem : They ' re saddled with huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>that require costly maintenance . 
2495 And try plying new dollars free in a market that is softening , hurt by a strong dollar and concerned about overcapacity - - the industry ' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darth Vadar </ENAMEX>. 
2648 ` The technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers </ENAMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Marcus </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc .  
2786 ` They ' ve got too much invested in the old stuff and they ca n't get their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>to be flexible . ' 
2886 No one expects <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">minimills </ENAMEX>to eclipse major integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers </ENAMEX>, who remain the undisputed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">kings </ENAMEX>of highest - quality <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">autos </ENAMEX>and refrigerators . 
3043 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nucor </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Crawfordsville </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ind . </ENAMEX>, ultimately will produce <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">only one million tons </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually </TIMEX>, a drop in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">40 - million - ton </NUMEX>- a - year flat - rolled steel bucket , and it will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years </TIMEX>before such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>can compete in the high - profit market . 
3279 Still , flat - rolled is the steel industry ' s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">bread </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">butter </ENAMEX>, representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half </NUMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">the 80 million tons </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>expected to be shipped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
3432 Moreover , the process is n't without its headaches . 
3483 Because all operations are connected , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>equipment failure forces a complete <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>shutdown . 
3577 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">some days </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nucor </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>does n't produce anything . 
3635 ` At this point , the minimill capacity wo n't make a great dent in the integrated market , but it does challenge them to develop new markets , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James McCall </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, materials , at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Battelle </ENAMEX>, a technology and management - research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant </ENAMEX>based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Columbus </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio </ENAMEX>. 
3904 Indeed , with demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>not growing fast enough to absorb capacity , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers </ENAMEX>will have to change the way they do business . 
4036 In the past , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armco </ENAMEX>' s chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Corey </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers </ENAMEX>made a product and set it out on the loading dock . 
4153 ` We said : ` We ' ve got a product : if you want it , you can buy it , ' ' he says , adding : ` Now we ' re figuring out what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>need , and are going back to make it . ' 
4313 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armco </ENAMEX>' s sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives </ENAMEX>visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CITY">Fairfax </ENAMEX>assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kansas City </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mo . </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two or three days </TIMEX>a week . 
4447 When they determined that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>needed parts more quickly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armco </ENAMEX>convinced a steel service <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center </ENAMEX>to build a processing <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant </ENAMEX>nearby so shipments could be delivered within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes </TIMEX>. 
4630 Cementing such relationships with major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients </ENAMEX>- - <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car </ENAMEX>and appliance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>- - is a means of survival , especially when those key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients </ENAMEX>are relying on a smaller pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers </ENAMEX>and flirting with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastic </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">aluminum </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>. 
4859 For example , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit </ENAMEX>began talking about plastic - bodied <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Iron and Steel Institute </ENAMEX>began a major lobbying effort to show <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>how they could use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled . 
5109 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers </ENAMEX>must also find new markets . 
5153 After letting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">aluminum </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>take the recycling lead , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers </ENAMEX>started a recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institute </ENAMEX>to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>. 
5346 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Battelle </ENAMEX>' s Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCall </ENAMEX>thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers </ENAMEX>should concentrate more on construction . 
5428 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weirton Steel Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Weirton </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">W . Va . </ENAMEX>, for example , is touting to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners </ENAMEX>fashionable steel doors , with leaded glass inserts , as a secure and energy - efficient alternative to wooden or aluminum ones . 
5629 Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers </ENAMEX>envision steel roofs covering suburbia . 
5689 Still others are looking at overseas markets . 
5735 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USX </ENAMEX>is funneling drilling pipe to steel - hungry <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union </ENAMEX>. 
5796 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmaker </ENAMEX>reactivated its overseas sales operation . 
5883 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Producers </ENAMEX>also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher - profit output , such as coated and electrogalvanized products , which remain beyond the reach of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">minimills </ENAMEX>. 
6059 Almost all capital - improvement programs announced by major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers </ENAMEX>within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past year </TIMEX>involve building electrogalvanizing lines , used to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>for such products as household appliances and car doors . 
6275 But unfortunately , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">segment </ENAMEX>is much smaller than the bread - and - butter flat - rolled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>. 
6368 ` It ' s like everyone climbing out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">QE II </ENAMEX>and getting into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">lifeboat </ENAMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Jacobson </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AUS Consultants </ENAMEX>.

6547 Although he does n't expect any bankruptcies , he does see more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>being sold or closed . 
6640 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Crandall </ENAMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Brookings Institute </ENAMEX>, agrees . 
6695 ` Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar , it ' s unlikely that consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">minimills </ENAMEX>. ' 
6896 Not to mention the incursion of imports . 
6937 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers </ENAMEX>, which have led the recent technology developments , are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992 </TIMEX>. 
7087 Moreover , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>can expect more competition from low - cost producing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Pacific Rim </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Latin American </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>. 
7200 A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Taiwanese </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmaker </ENAMEX>recently announced plans to build a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nucor </ENAMEX>- like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>.

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright </ENAMEX>is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side , everything loose would end up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>. 
145 We ' ve always thought that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright </ENAMEX>underestimated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>' s vitality , but maybe the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state </ENAMEX>' s la - la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place . 
333 What else is one to make of the whacky save - the - earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups </ENAMEX>and organized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general </ENAMEX>? 
499 If passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters </ENAMEX>, the recently announced initiative would phase out major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pesticides </ENAMEX>, reduce carbon dioxide emissions by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 % </NUMEX>, ban new offshore drilling , ban <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals </ENAMEX>thought to deplete the ozone layer , and create a new state environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer </ENAMEX>armed with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million </NUMEX>budget to sue any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agency </ENAMEX>he thinks is being too dirty . 
842 The initiative is based largely on the wish - lists of the green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">lobby </ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sierra Club </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">League of Conservation Voters </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Natural Resources Defense Council </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">National Toxics Campaign </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Citizens for a Better Environment </ENAMEX>. 
1075 Interestingly , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Environmental Defense Fund </ENAMEX>is having nothing to do with this one . 
1162 Not only <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Californians </ENAMEX>but all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans </ENAMEX>would pay if this thing passed . 
1234 The initiative bars the sale of any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">crops </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>that do n't meet the initiative ' s standards . 
1334 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kansas </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">fruit </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers </ENAMEX>would have to adjust or give up the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>market . 
1436 In other words , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>is presuming to take control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s farm policy . 
1523 As usual the green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">lobby </ENAMEX>' s proposal is disconnected from scientific reality . 
1600 Consider the greenhouse - effect provision . 
1642 The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">carbon dioxide </ENAMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 % </NUMEX>. 
1718 Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is inconceivable that reductions in a single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state </ENAMEX>could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem . 
1886 But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ? 
1998 The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsors </ENAMEX>themselves will benefit . 
2110 The key here is the ambition of state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Van de Kamp </ENAMEX>. 
2183 He ' s running for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor </ENAMEX>. 
2212 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp </ENAMEX>is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups </ENAMEX>and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov . 6 , 1990 </TIMEX>. 
2417 That ' s also <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>of the gubernatorial election . 
2470 The initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">weepers </ENAMEX>who donate money . 
2603 And it allows Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp </ENAMEX>to get around campaign spending limits . 
2673 He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp </ENAMEX>initiative -LRB- on which there are no limits -RRB- is gravy . 
2811 This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback . 
2908 -LRB- The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Wilson </ENAMEX>, is playing the initiative fundraising game too , sponsoring his own crime initiative . -RRB- 
3041 While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional , it is of course conceivable that in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>it could slide through . 
3202 This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state </ENAMEX>that recently passed the Prop . 65 anti - toxic initiative . 
3277 If this new proposal ever does become law , the green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">lobby </ENAMEX>will benefit directly . 
3361 The initiative creates a free floating state environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer </ENAMEX>to sue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>or government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies </ENAMEX>that do things he does n't like . 
3500 That means the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NRDC </ENAMEX>and such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">groups </ENAMEX>no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers </ENAMEX>would bear the cost . 
3628 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp </ENAMEX>and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">allies </ENAMEX>may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple - pie issue among certain segments of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population </ENAMEX>now that almost any collection of anti - scientific , anti - pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric . 
3881 Of course the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals </ENAMEX>are not yet a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>unto themselves . 
3950 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush </ENAMEX>, for example , may decide that he does n't want to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX>who lost control of interstate commerce to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general </ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>. 
4108 And some other segments of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>' s political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state </ENAMEX>' s less affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens </ENAMEX>in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs . 
4343 This grandiose initiative will help <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>define itself for the future either as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state </ENAMEX>still tethered to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led to wherever its la - la <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists </ENAMEX>want to take it .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burmah Oil PLC </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>independent oil and specialty chemicals marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SHV Holdings N . V . </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Netherlands </ENAMEX>has built up a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 . 7 % </NUMEX>stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
180 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Alexander </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burmah </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SHV </ENAMEX>had previously owned ` <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a little under 5 % </NUMEX>' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burmah </ENAMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about two years </TIMEX>. 
298 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Dutch </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>had n't notified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burmah </ENAMEX>of its reason for increasing the stake , he said . 
390 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SHV </ENAMEX>, which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>merged its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">North Sea </ENAMEX>oil and gas operations with those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Calor Group PLC </ENAMEX>, has been pegged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators </ENAMEX>as a possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suitor </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burmah Oil </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks </TIMEX>. 
570 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SHV </ENAMEX>also owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Calor </ENAMEX>. 
600 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burmah </ENAMEX>, which owns the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Castrol </ENAMEX>brand of lubricant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oils </ENAMEX>, reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 % </NUMEX>rise in net income to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 43 . 5 million </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 68 . 3 million </NUMEX>-RRB- in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half </TIMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxus Energy Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas </ENAMEX>, said it discovered a new oil field northeast of its previously discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Intan Field </ENAMEX>in the southeast <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Sumatra </ENAMEX>area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Indonesia </ENAMEX>. 
169 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxus </ENAMEX>said it did n't run a production test on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>discovery <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wells </ENAMEX>it drilled in the field , which is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">about 1 . 6 miles </NUMEX>from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Intan Field </ENAMEX>, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wells </ENAMEX>are similar to others drilled at its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Intan </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Widuri </ENAMEX>fields . 
395 However , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxus </ENAMEX>said it believes the reserves in the field are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">about 10 million barrels </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil </ENAMEX>. 
490 The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Intan Field </ENAMEX>has estimated reserves of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">50 million barrels </NUMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Widuri Field </ENAMEX>has estimated reserves of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">225 million barrels </NUMEX>. 
621 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxus </ENAMEX>, an independent oil and gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator </ENAMEX>and owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a 56 % </NUMEX>interest in the new field , called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast Intan </ENAMEX>.

9 The market upheaval apparently has n't triggered any cash crunch - - yet . 
83 Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>, investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers </ENAMEX>who speculate in the stocks of takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates </ENAMEX>can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive ; those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans . 
352 But several large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that would signal such difficulties . 
482 ` We ' re seeing nothing out of the ordinary , ' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>at a Top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>. 
562 ` That ' s good news , because we all swim in this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water </ENAMEX>. ' 
617 Added another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>at a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>: ` We were all a little goosey over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>trying to forecast what would happen -LCB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>-RCB- , but it ' s been very quiet . 
775 Now , as for tomorrow , hell , who knows ?  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amcore Financial Inc . </ENAMEX>said it agreed to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Central of Illinois Inc . </ENAMEX>in a stock swap . 
101 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shareholders </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Central </ENAMEX>, a bank holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sterling </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill . </ENAMEX>, will receive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amcore </ENAMEX>stock equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 </NUMEX>times <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Central </ENAMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>earnings , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amcore </ENAMEX>said . 
256 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first nine months of 1989 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Central </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 million </NUMEX>. 
320 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amcore </ENAMEX>, also a bank holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, has assets of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 06 billion </NUMEX>. 
386 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Central </ENAMEX>' s assets are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 240 million </NUMEX>.  

9 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon </ENAMEX>is a haunted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house </ENAMEX>. 
42 Living there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six years </TIMEX>was really scary . 
87 The ghosts of the past are everywhere : They are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget . 
209 Some can be bought off relatively cheaply . 
252 During the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">Korean War </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas MacArthur </ENAMEX>demanded and got , in addition to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . N . </ENAMEX>command in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Korea </ENAMEX>, his own naval <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">command </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NavforJapan </ENAMEX>. 
403 Those obsolete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">operations </ENAMEX>cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 2 billion </NUMEX>a year , and keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac </ENAMEX>' s ghost quiet . 
493 That ' s about all it costs to appease <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adm . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erich Raeder </ENAMEX>' s ghost . 
557 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1941 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raeder </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">navy </ENAMEX>threatened to attack the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Panama Canal </ENAMEX>, so we created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Southern Command </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama </ENAMEX>. 
678 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Southern Command </ENAMEX>has grown even bigger since the war because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raeder </ENAMEX>' s ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega </ENAMEX>. 
819 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Command </ENAMEX>' s huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracy </ENAMEX>is needed to analyze whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>of coups against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega </ENAMEX>meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War Powers Act </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six </NUMEX>points , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap Weinberger </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX>points , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Intelligence Committee </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 </NUMEX>points and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodrow Wilson </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 </NUMEX>points necessary to justify <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>support . 
1091 So far no one has . 
1112 The ghost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">brigade </ENAMEX>discovered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cuba </ENAMEX>back in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">' 70s </TIMEX>costs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just a few hundred million </NUMEX>: the price of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Caribbean Command </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Key West </ENAMEX>that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter </ENAMEX>created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980 </TIMEX>. 
1300 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">brigade </ENAMEX>has n't been heard from since , but we keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff </ENAMEX>around just in case . 
1387 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Marshall </ENAMEX>' s ghost is much more difficult to keep happy . 
1449 We keep a lot of shrines to him around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon </ENAMEX>: statues , busts , relics and such . 
1535 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters </ENAMEX>on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">deck </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon </ENAMEX>used to burn a lot of incense to him , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters </ENAMEX>on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">deck </ENAMEX>made them stop it . 
1693 You see , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall </ENAMEX>had this thing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Marines </ENAMEX>- - he wanted to make them part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army </ENAMEX>but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Forrestal </ENAMEX>blocked him . 
1855 Now his ghost wo n't let up till it ' s done . 
1900 To keep him quiet we invent a new unified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">command </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every year </TIMEX>or so run by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army </ENAMEX>or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force </ENAMEX>and put more of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Marines </ENAMEX>under it . 
2047 But we still hear him moaning at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night </TIMEX>because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX>has a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships </ENAMEX>left , and to satisfy him the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX>' s sea lift <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces </ENAMEX>were given to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracy </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois </ENAMEX>, its space operations to another command in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colorado </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">frogmen </ENAMEX>to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracy </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fort Bragg </ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Indian Ocean </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Persian Gulf </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces </ENAMEX>to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracy </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>. 
2421 Which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all - - the ghost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran </ENAMEX>. 
2506 When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah </ENAMEX>died , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter </ENAMEX>was so scared that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah </ENAMEX>' s ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ayatollah </ENAMEX>that he declared the Carter Doctrine . 
2683 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter </ENAMEX>said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran </ENAMEX>. 
2759 But that ghost would n't settle for words , he wanted money and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>- - lots . 
2837 So Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter </ENAMEX>formed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">divisions </ENAMEX>and gave them to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracy </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tampa </ENAMEX>called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Rapid Deployment Force </ENAMEX>. 
2962 But that ghost was n't fooled ; he knew the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RDF </ENAMEX>was neither rapid nor deployable nor a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force </ENAMEX>- - even though it cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 billion </NUMEX>or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion </NUMEX>a year . 
3112 After Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter </ENAMEX>was defeated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980 </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah </ENAMEX>' s ghost claimed the credit and then went after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap Weinberger </ENAMEX>. 
3244 I saw what he did to them firsthand . 
3281 It made my shoelaces dance with terror . 
3321 Why , he used to lay in wait for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap </ENAMEX>; suddenly he ' d leap from behind some statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall </ENAMEX>onto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap </ENAMEX>' s chest and grab him by the throat and choke him till he coughed up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 2 billion </NUMEX>or so . 
3524 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap </ENAMEX>added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">divisions </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>active and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>reserve ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX>; a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">division </ENAMEX>- - equivalent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Marines </ENAMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">C - 5B </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">KC - 10 </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">C - 17 </ENAMEX>and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand </NUMEX>tactical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force </ENAMEX>. 
3745 He bought <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion </NUMEX>in prepositioning <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships </ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 billion </NUMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">ammo </ENAMEX>and equipment to fill them , and parked them at a new <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">base </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Diego Garcia </ENAMEX>in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Indian Ocean </ENAMEX>. 
3933 He dedicated all these new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Persian Gulf </ENAMEX>. 
3990 <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">One night </TIMEX>both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall </ENAMEX>' s ghost and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah </ENAMEX>' s ghost together caught <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap </ENAMEX>and threw him to the ground . 
4092 Before they let him go he added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RDF </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tampa </ENAMEX>and renamed it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Central Command </ENAMEX>. 
4199 He gave those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats </ENAMEX>charge of all naval operations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Persian Gulf </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Indian Ocean </ENAMEX>. 
4296 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall </ENAMEX>figured it would be good training for those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers </ENAMEX>- - someday maybe they would get the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX>. 
4406 They had fun moving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">carriers </ENAMEX>around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers . 
4514 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah </ENAMEX>still kept leaping out at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap </ENAMEX>, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap </ENAMEX>bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred </NUMEX>merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships </ENAMEX>more and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 billion </NUMEX>of loading <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">barges </ENAMEX>, ramps , etc . , in order that those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX>new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">divisions </ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Marine </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">brigades </ENAMEX>could unload from all those new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft </ENAMEX>and go to war in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Zagros mountains </ENAMEX>. 
4812 Then suddenly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ike </ENAMEX>' s ghost came to visit and said , ` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">12 , 000 miles </NUMEX>away ? 
4942 We ' d get our asses kicked . ' 
4970 Lucky for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ike </ENAMEX>was easygoing and soon went away , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah </ENAMEX>- - he kept coming back . 
5062 So the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>found itself paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 billion </NUMEX>in baksheesh to various <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arab </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">potentates </ENAMEX>for basing rights around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Indian Ocean </ENAMEX>. 
5196 We had great success in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Somalia </ENAMEX>. 
5229 But then it turned out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siad Barrah </ENAMEX>was not at all a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX>pointed out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">base </ENAMEX>he promised us in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berbera </ENAMEX>had silted up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">about a hundred years ago </TIMEX>and anyway was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">1 , 244 miles </NUMEX>from the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Gulf </ENAMEX>. 
5468 -LRB- But who ' s counting . -RRB- 
5490 Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berbera </ENAMEX>was the best we could get , so we stay in bed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrah </ENAMEX>. 
5573 All these reports about him committing genocide are probably exaggerated anyway . 
5656 But would n't you know , now that we are spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">jillions of dollars </NUMEX>, and have built those new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">divisions </ENAMEX>and new air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">wings </ENAMEX>, and have positioned all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships </ENAMEX>and supplies to fight the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russians </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russians </ENAMEX>seem to have lost interest in the whole subject . 
5921 Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget . 
6005 Predictably , some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys </ENAMEX>said : ` Do we still need to keep <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 18 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">divisions </ENAMEX>on active duty and all those extra land - based <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft </ENAMEX>without <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">bases </ENAMEX>and all those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys </ENAMEX>playing admiral in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tampa </ENAMEX>? 
6206 Could n't we save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 billion </NUMEX>or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 billion </NUMEX>a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves ? 
6297 And why not save the costs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats </ENAMEX>by abolishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Central Command </ENAMEX>and putting responsibility for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Gulf </ENAMEX>naval operations back where it belongs , afloat with the task force <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Gulf </ENAMEX>? 
6506 And where were all our handsomely paid <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Indian Ocean </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">allies </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>when our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">convoys </ENAMEX>were being attacked ? ' 
6616 Questions like that really stir up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall </ENAMEX>' s ghost . 
6669 He appeared <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late one night </TIMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">bedroom </ENAMEX>of the new defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney </ENAMEX>. 
6754 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall </ENAMEX>came clanking in like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marley </ENAMEX>' s ghost dragging those chains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">brigades </ENAMEX>and air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">wings </ENAMEX>and links with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arab </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">despots </ENAMEX>. 
6877 He would n't leave until Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney </ENAMEX>promised to do whatever the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon </ENAMEX>systems <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>told him . 
6978 So <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next day </TIMEX>Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney </ENAMEX>went out and did just that : He canceled the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600 </NUMEX>- ship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX>and cut back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">carrier </ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">frigates </ENAMEX>. 
7101 Then he canceled production of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX>' s most important carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">F - 14 </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">A - 6 </ENAMEX>. 
7198 On the other hand , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney </ENAMEX>retained all those new land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces </ENAMEX>. 
7264 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall </ENAMEX>' s ghost is satisfied for now , but he ' ll be back . 
7324 What with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Halloween </TIMEX>coming and bigger defense cuts looming , more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats </ENAMEX>are crawling under their desks . 
7451 They know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">carriers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships </ENAMEX>. 
7553 Then the whole thing will start to collapse , just as it did in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s </TIMEX>, and the ghosts and banshees will be howling through the place turning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>' s hair white . 
7718 Gives me the willies just thinking about it . 
7765 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>, is a managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber </ENAMEX>.

879 The downgrades were prompted , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody ' s </ENAMEX>said , by the continuing turmoil in the junk bond market and the suspension of dividends on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust ' s </ENAMEX>preferred stock .

215 In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 25 minutes </TIMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday </TIMEX>' s trading the Nikkei index soared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">664 . 83 </NUMEX>points , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35133 . 83 </NUMEX>. 
312 By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 a . m . </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>time , the index was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435 . 11 </NUMEX>points , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34903 . 80 </NUMEX>as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>hailed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>' s overnight rally . 
429 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>' s slide came in a relatively calm session that did n't provide much direction for other markets . 
534 Shares also closed sharply lower across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>, particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt </ENAMEX>, although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>. 
714 Other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Pacific </ENAMEX>markets had sharper losses than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>, but the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash . 
853 All eyes were on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>at the opening because it was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>major market to trade since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 . 58 </NUMEX>- point plunge on Wall Street . 
989 But rather than set the tone for other markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>' s major institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>chose to remain on the sidelines . 
1109 Still , despite the sudden reappearance of stock - market turbulence , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>investment funds said they were n't planning to unload <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX>equities . 
1280 ` We did n't trade much <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>, as our policy now is to wait and see , ' said a fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Taisho Life Insurance Co .  
1397 ` We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>. ' 
1486 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>appeared confident that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators </ENAMEX>would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary , and there was considerable speculation during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance Ministry </ENAMEX>was working behind the scenes to do just that . 
1728 But in the absence of panicky trading , its presence was never overtly felt . 
1806 At the close , the Nikkei average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225 </NUMEX>stocks stood at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34468 . 69 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">647 . 33 </NUMEX>points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 8 % </NUMEX>. 
1901 The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 . 66 </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 7 % </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2600 . 88 </NUMEX>. 
1970 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day </TIMEX>' s decline was generally in line with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>' weekend predictions . 
2046 Declining issues swamped advancers , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">941 </NUMEX>- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105 </NUMEX>. 
2091 But volume was thin at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">526 . 2 million </NUMEX>shares , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">574 . 7 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
2174 The market opened sharply lower , with the Nikkei average down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 600 </NUMEX>after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes </TIMEX>. 
2265 A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midmorning </TIMEX>rebound brought it back to show a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 200 </NUMEX>at the end of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning </TIMEX>session , but the rally failed in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>, and the market closed near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>' s low . 
2448 The smaller stocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>market ' s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>section also posted their biggest decline of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year </TIMEX>. 
2551 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tokyo Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>index for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>section fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 . 96 </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 . 7 % </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3655 . 40 </NUMEX>. 
2639 Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>, trying to outperform the market ' s major indexes , have flocked to these small issues in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks </TIMEX>. 
2758 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>expressed relief that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>market did n't fall more sharply . 
2854 But its performance did bear some resemblance to events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>, during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>global stock market crash . 
2981 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 16 , 1987 </TIMEX>- - the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>before the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>crash - - the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>market dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 . 6 % </NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>followed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 . 4 % </NUMEX>drop . 
3126 This time , Wall Street ' s plunge of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 . 9 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>was followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 8 % </NUMEX>loss in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>. 
3223 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>' s biggest fall came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 . 6 % </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>plunge , when the Nikkei average fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 . 9 % </NUMEX>. 
3352 Thus , market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>were looking ahead nervously to Wall Street ' s opening . 
3443 But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88 . 12 </NUMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2657 . 38 </NUMEX>on heavy volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">416 , 290 , 000 </NUMEX>shares , although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market . 
3657 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nobuto Yasuda </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yamaichi Investment Trust &amp; Management Co . </ENAMEX>, called <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s session ` a good scenario ' for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>. 
3786 ` Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders , ' he said . 
3850 ` For us institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>, the chance for buying has come . ' 
3918 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isao Ushikubo </ENAMEX>, general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>of the investment research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyo Trust &amp; Banking Co . </ENAMEX>, also was optimistic . 
4037 He described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>as a ` fleeting ' event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity . 
4168 ` Unless there is a panic , this is the best time to buy , as was the case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>, ' he said . 
4265 ` Those shares which had posted gains on M &amp; A speculation were dashed with cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water </ENAMEX>, but as far as major stocks are concerned , there is n't much impact . ' 
4420 Other fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>were similarly sanguine . 
4465 ` We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masato Murakami </ENAMEX>, chief portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>in the pension fund management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co .  
4654 He said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s Wall Street decline was ` well within the range of volatility ' that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yasuda Trust </ENAMEX>plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy . 
4812 Among other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Pacific </ENAMEX>markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Singapore </ENAMEX>had the biggest losses , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kuala Lumpur </ENAMEX>composite index in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia </ENAMEX>falling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 . 5 % </NUMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Singapore </ENAMEX>' s Straits Times Industrial Index down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>. 
5019 Major indexes declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 8 % </NUMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand </ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 . 5 % </NUMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>. 
5107 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bangkok </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manila </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seoul </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Taipei </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jakarta </ENAMEX>escaped with slightly smaller losses . 
5190 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Brokers </ENAMEX>and fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>said the region ' s markets were reacting to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy - outs and a deteriorating junk - bond market . 
5411 ` It ' s pure psychology , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Au Yeung </ENAMEX>, an account <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert -LRB- HK -RRB- Ltd . </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>. 
5530 ` Markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy - outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there ' s no doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia </ENAMEX>is still following <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America </ENAMEX>' s lead . ' 
5712 Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Singapore </ENAMEX>had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows . 
5834 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>is the region ' s next most open market , but many foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>have been staying away from it since it plunged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June </TIMEX>amid political turmoil in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>. 
6001 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Singapore </ENAMEX>took the hit because when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>want to get out , they tend to go where the liquidity is , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Hambrecht </ENAMEX>, a regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Baring Securities -LRB- Hong Kong -RRB- Ltd .  
6188 She pointed out that even after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>decline , the Straits Times index is up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>who bailed out generally did so profitably . 
6344 Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kuala Lumpur </ENAMEX>' s composite index <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>ended <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 . 5 % </NUMEX>above its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>close . 
6432 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>, the Hang Seng Index fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180 . 60 </NUMEX>to finish at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2601 . 70 </NUMEX>. 
6500 Trading was heavy at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one billion </NUMEX>shares , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">473 . 9 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
6583 But the session was orderly , in contrast to the market ' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four - day </TIMEX>closure after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash . 
6681 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Chenevix - Trench </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Baring International Fund Managers Ltd . </ENAMEX>, said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close . 
6838 ` If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>does n't collapse , I see maybe another <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % </NUMEX>on the downside , not counting the risk of bad news out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>, ' he said . 
6969 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sydney </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">All Ordinaries </ENAMEX>index closed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1601 . 5 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 . 1 % </NUMEX>, its biggest drop since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>. 
7079 But volume rose only to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162 million </NUMEX>shares from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">143 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
7149 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nestor Hinzack </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burdett , Buckeridge &amp; Young Ltd . </ENAMEX>, described the market ' s performance as ` sheep - like ' as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>fled to bluechip <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian </ENAMEX>stocks and shunned entrepreneurial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price . 
7435 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Times - Stock Exchange </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>- share index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2163 . 4 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 . 5 </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 . 2 % </NUMEX>. 
7593 At its low , shortly before Wall Street opened , it was off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 130 </NUMEX>points . 
7675 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Times </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 </NUMEX>- share index closed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79 . 3 </NUMEX>points lower at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1738 . 7 </NUMEX>. 
7746 Volume more than doubled to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">959 . 3 million </NUMEX>shares from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">457 . 7 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
7824 Prices on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Frankfurt Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>tumbled in heavy trading . 
7889 The decline in the German Stock Index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">203 . 56 </NUMEX>points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 . 8 % </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1385 . 72 </NUMEX>was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt </ENAMEX>market ' s steepest fall ever . 
8015 Retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>dumped holdings on a massive scale , pushing some blue - chip shares down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 20 % </NUMEX>. 
8119 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>cited memories of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>, when many small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>held on to their shares after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October </TIMEX>crash but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German </ENAMEX>market continued to decline steeply for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next three months </TIMEX>. 
8320 Here are price trends on the world ' s major stock markets , as calculated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Geneva </ENAMEX>. 
8453 To make them directly comparable , each index is based on the close of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1969 </TIMEX>equaling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>. 
8542 The percentage change is since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - end </TIMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J . P . Industries Inc . </ENAMEX>said it signed a definitive agreement to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Builders ' Hardware Group </ENAMEX>to closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nalcor Inc . </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .  
160 Terms were n't disclosed , but a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J . P . Industries </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said the amount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J . P . Industries </ENAMEX>will get for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>is ` a little better than expected by the marketplace , and the marketplace had been expecting <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 million to $ 30 million </NUMEX>. ' 
396 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weslock Corp . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">JPI Modern Inc .  
452 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J . P . Industries </ENAMEX>, which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ann Arbor </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich . </ENAMEX>, said the sale completes a previously announced program to divest itself of its hardware and plumbing supplies operations . 
627 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s remaining business is the manufacture and sale of engine and transmissions products for industrial and transportation applications .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Environmental Systems Co . </ENAMEX>said it is restating its results to reduce its reported net income for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months of its fiscal year </TIMEX>after discovering it took tax credits that already had been taken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>. 
226 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Little Rock </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ark . </ENAMEX>, hazardous - waste services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said the restatement will reduce its net for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months ended July 31 </TIMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 5 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 cents </NUMEX>a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 7 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">26 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
435 Net for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, restated , is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 6 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
510 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>previously reported net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 3 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
586 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said that for financial reporting purposes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>it took tax credits that will be recognized for tax purposes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
723 But because of confusion , it took those credits again in reporting its results through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months </TIMEX>. 
833 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack W . Forrest </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Environmental Systems </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>, said the change increases the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s effective tax rate to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 35 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 % </NUMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seafirst Corp . </ENAMEX>said it signed an agreement with builder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Selig </ENAMEX>to purchase its headquarters <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Columbia Seafirst Center </ENAMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 354 million </NUMEX>.

9 Many skittish mutual fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>picked up the phone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, but decided not to cash in their chips after all . 
128 As the stock market bounced back , withdrawals of money from stock funds amounted to a mere trickle compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>dumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 3 billion </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2 % </NUMEX>of stock - fund assets . 
327 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity Investments </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s largest fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, said phone volume was more than double its typical level , but still <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 19 , 1987 </TIMEX>. 
480 Net outflows from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>' s stock funds stood at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 300 million </NUMEX>, or below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % </NUMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion </NUMEX>cash position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>' s stock portfolios . 
631 Much of the money was switched into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>' s money market funds . 
698 Outflows since the close of trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>remain below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one - third </NUMEX>their level of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>said . 
811 Other mutual fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>reported even lighter withdrawal requests . 
882 And some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>and elsewhere even began buying stock funds during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>. 
975 ` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago </TIMEX>, there was a lot of redemption activity and trouble with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>getting through on the phone , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathryn McGrath </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of the investment management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission </ENAMEX>. 
1193 This time , ` We do n't have that at all . ' 
1235 Of course , the relative calm could be jolted if the market plunges again . 
1309 And any strong surge in redemptions could force some funds to dump stocks to raise cash , as some did during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>. 
1433 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">funds </ENAMEX>generally are better prepared this time around . 
1491 As a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>, their cash position of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 . 2 % </NUMEX>of assets in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>- - the latest figure available - - is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 % </NUMEX>higher than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years earlier </TIMEX>. 
1624 Many fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>have boosted their cash levels in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks </TIMEX>. 
1693 The biggest flurry of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX>activity came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early in the day </TIMEX>. 
1756 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vanguard Group Inc . </ENAMEX>saw heavy exchanges from stock funds into money market funds after the telephone lines opened at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 : 30 a . m </TIMEX>. 
1883 ` In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour </TIMEX>, the real nervous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks </ENAMEX>came along , ' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said . 
1957 ` But the horrendous pace of call volume in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first half - hour </TIMEX>slowed considerably . ' 
2044 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scudder , Stevens &amp; Clark Inc . </ENAMEX>, phone calls came in at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 % </NUMEX>more than the normal pace through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early afternoon </TIMEX>. 
2156 Most of that increase came in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour </TIMEX>after the phone lines opened at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 a . m </TIMEX>. 
2242 As stocks rose , in fact , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>changed course and reversed their sell orders . 
2329 Many funds allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>to void orders before the close of trading . 
2402 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scudder </ENAMEX>and at the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ivy </ENAMEX>funds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hingham </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass . </ENAMEX>, for instance , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>called <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning </TIMEX>to switch money from stock funds to money market funds , but later called back to reverse the switches . 
2630 Because mutual fund trades do n't take effect until the market close - - in this case , at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 p . m . </TIMEX>- - these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>effectively stayed put . 
2773 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Sherman </ENAMEX>walked in shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 : 30 a . m . </TIMEX>and placed an order to switch his retirement accounts out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>stock funds and into a money market fund . 
2972 But by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 : 15 p . m . </TIMEX>, with the market comfortably ahead for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman </ENAMEX>was preparing to undo his switch . 
3085 ` It ' s a nice feeling to know that things stabilized , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman </ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">51 - year - old </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co - owner </ENAMEX>of a discount department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store </ENAMEX>. 
3216 But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>continued to switch out of high - risk , high - yield junk funds despite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s rebound from that market ' s recent price declines . 
3367 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shareholders </ENAMEX>have been steadily bailing out of several big junk funds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past several weeks </TIMEX>as the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 billion </NUMEX>market was jolted by a cash crunch at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp . </ENAMEX>and steadily declining prices . 
3563 Much of the money has been switched into money market funds , fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>say . 
3647 Instead of selling bonds to meet redemptions , however , some funds have borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>to meet withdrawal requests . 
3767 This avoids knocking down prices further . 
3809 The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 1 billion </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T . Rowe Price High Yield Fund </ENAMEX>was among the funds that borrowed during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau </ENAMEX>crisis , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George J . Collins </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T . Rowe Price Associates Inc .  
3986 That way , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins </ENAMEX>says , ` We did n't have to sell securities in a sloppy market . ' 
4070 When the market stabilized , he added , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>sold the bonds and quickly paid the loans back . 
4167 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Herman </ENAMEX>contributed to this article .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard G . Sim </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>credited with transforming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Applied Power Inc . </ENAMEX>from an underachiever into a feisty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">player </ENAMEX>in the global market for hydraulic tools , hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s latest acquisition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barry Wright Corp .  
258 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">45 - year - old </TIMEX>former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>figures it will be easier this time . 
349 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>, while applauding the acquisition , say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Applied </ENAMEX>' s chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>faces a tough challenge in integrating the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>. 
487 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barry Wright </ENAMEX>, acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Applied </ENAMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 147 million </NUMEX>, makes computer - room equipment and vibration - control systems . 
600 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Watertown </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped . 
686 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year </TIMEX>' s earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 3 million </NUMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 815 , 000 </NUMEX>from a restructuring gain , were far below the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier </TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 . 4 million </NUMEX>. 
818 Besides spurring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barry Wright </ENAMEX>' s sales , which were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 201 . 7 million </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sim </ENAMEX>must pare its costs and product line . 
938 ` The question is how long it ' s going to take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barry Wright </ENAMEX>to make a contribution , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F . John Mirek </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blunt Ellis Loewi </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Milwaukee </ENAMEX>. 
1089 The answer will help determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Applied </ENAMEX>continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sim </ENAMEX>. 
1191 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Butler </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wis . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer </ENAMEX>went public at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 . 75 </NUMEX>a share in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 1987 </TIMEX>, and Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sim </ENAMEX>' s goal then was a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 29 </NUMEX>per - share price by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992 </TIMEX>. 
1327 Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 1988 </TIMEX>. 
1415 The stock has since softened , trading around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 </NUMEX>a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>and closing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23 . 00 </NUMEX>in national over - the - counter trading . 
1552 But Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sim </ENAMEX>has set a fresh target of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 </NUMEX>a share by the end of 
1618 Reaching that goal , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert T . Foote </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Applied </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer </ENAMEX>, will require ` efficient reinvestment ' of cash by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Applied </ENAMEX>and continuation of its healthy <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 % </NUMEX>rate of return on operating capital . 
1827 In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barry Wright </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sim </ENAMEX>sees a situation ` very similar ' to the one he faced when he joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Applied </ENAMEX>as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief operating officer </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985 </TIMEX>. 
1977 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Applied </ENAMEX>, then a closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, was stagnating under the management of its controlling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family </ENAMEX>. 
2078 While profitable , it ` was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital , ' he says . 
2191 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sim </ENAMEX>is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barry Wright </ENAMEX>as it has at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Applied .  
2309 He also professes an ` evangelical ' fervor to develop a corporate culture that rewards <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>who produce and where decision - making is shared . 
2455 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sim </ENAMEX>considers the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>' s operations ` fundamentally sound ' and adds that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barry Wright </ENAMEX>has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>. 
2642 ` With a little patience , these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses </ENAMEX>will perform very satisfactorily , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sim </ENAMEX>says . 
2733 Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">about six months </TIMEX>, ` things will be moving in the right direction , ' he predicts . 
2821 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sim </ENAMEX>figures it will be easier to turn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barry Wright </ENAMEX>around since he ' s now in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver </ENAMEX>' s seat . 
2920 When he came to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Applied </ENAMEX>, ` I did n't have the power to execute as I do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>, ' he says . 
3006 He was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Applied </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>and became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last November </TIMEX>. 
3099 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Applied </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sim </ENAMEX>set growth as his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>objective . 
3154 He took the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>public in an offering that netted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Applied </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 12 . 6 million </NUMEX>, which helped launch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s acquisition program . 
3292 Sales climbed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 245 million </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989 , ended Aug . 31 </TIMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 99 . 9 million </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1985 </TIMEX>. 
3401 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>expects that earnings , which have marched steadily upward in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">recent years </TIMEX>, reached <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 20 . 8 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 58 </NUMEX>a share , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal year </TIMEX>just ended , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 . 2 million </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1988 </TIMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 9 million </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985 </TIMEX>.  

9 The metal and marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lobby </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust Bank </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters </ENAMEX>is grander than your average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">savings and loan </ENAMEX>. 
115 For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>thing , there is an old master on the wall - - ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Samuel Anointing David </ENAMEX>, ' a big baroque canvas painted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mattia Preti </ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">17th - century </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Neapolitan </ENAMEX>. 
269 At the moment , however , the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>and its flamboyant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David L . Paul </ENAMEX>. 
436 In an international buying spree that began barely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>amassed a collection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">pre - 18th - century </TIMEX>works , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preti </ENAMEX>, at a total cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28 million </NUMEX>. 
623 By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 6 </TIMEX>, all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off , under orders from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller </ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office </ENAMEX>regulates the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S &amp; Ls </ENAMEX>. 
783 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>did n't meet the deadline . 
820 The collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>had in which the art was to do double duty - - as an investment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>and as decoration for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S &amp; L </ENAMEX>' s new office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">tower </ENAMEX>, designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I . M . Pei </ENAMEX>. 
1029 The rub is that the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28 million </NUMEX>was plucked from the funds of this federally insured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution </ENAMEX>even as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>was losing money hand over fist . 
1176 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>had no right to buy art for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S &amp; L </ENAMEX>in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>place - - it is n't on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller </ENAMEX>' s ` permissible ' list - - without seeking a special dispensation , which he did not do . 
1356 Besides that , some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>actually ended up hanging in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">estate </ENAMEX>on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">La Gorce Isle </ENAMEX>off <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami Beach </ENAMEX>. 
1520 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last spring </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office </ENAMEX>called a halt to Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>' s fling , giving him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six months </TIMEX>to sell the paintings . 
1638 The acquisitions , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>said in a letter to Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>, were ` unsafe , unsound and unauthorized . ' 
1737 So far , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>has unloaded but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>of his masterpieces , he wo n't say to whom . 
1820 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office </ENAMEX>says it is ` monitoring the situation . ' 
1884 Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency </ENAMEX>could remove Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>, it has no current intention to do that . 
1967 ` It ' s not like selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevrolets </ENAMEX>, ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>says , as he takes a drag on a goldbanded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">St . Moritz </ENAMEX>cigarette . 
2075 ` The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">last six months </TIMEX>has established the quality of the collection . 
2143 There ' s no fire sale here . ' 
2173 Despite Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>' s characteristic hauteur , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">50 - year - old </TIMEX>, chain - smoking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dynamo </ENAMEX>is finding that getting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>- - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>' s largest thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution </ENAMEX>- - out of its riskiest investments is much tougher than getting into them had been . 
2411 Paintings are just part of the picture . 
2451 Although Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>has pared a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 35 billion </NUMEX>junk - bond portfolio to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 900 million </NUMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April </TIMEX>, the high - yield debt market has plummeted . 
2596 Divesting itself of what is left , as is required of all thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1994 </TIMEX>under the new federal S &amp; L bailout law , may well prove difficult . 
2752 And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>has other problems . 
2785 Late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>ordered the thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution </ENAMEX>to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock - - a move that suggests deep concern about an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution </ENAMEX>. 
2957 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>has a plan to bring in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million </NUMEX>by selling off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches </ENAMEX>, but it has yet to be approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>. 
3094 It is Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>' s art venture , however , that has drawn the most attention from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>, not to mention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">galleries </ENAMEX>throughout the world . 
3245 Embittered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>-LRB- some of whom are suing -RRB- say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and his collection epitomize the excesses of speculation that set off the national S &amp; L crisis . 
3406 -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 . 125 </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>to close <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 875 </NUMEX>. -RRB- 
3514 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Gallery </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors </ENAMEX>, meanwhile , say Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>and others of his ilk have left an indelible mark on the art world - - and not for the better . 
3653 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Collectors </ENAMEX>do n't say ` It ' s a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh </ENAMEX>' anymore , laments <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Brooks </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wildenstein &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">gallery </ENAMEX>. 
3779 ` They say , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Payson </ENAMEX>got <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 53 million </NUMEX>for his , so certainly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million </NUMEX>is n't too much for mine . 
3880 ' The great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors </ENAMEX>we depended on , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Mellon </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norton Simon </ENAMEX>, have stopped buying , and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>are brilliant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men </ENAMEX>who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting . . . 
4097 . ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Payson </ENAMEX>, an art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collector </ENAMEX>, sold <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent van Gogh </ENAMEX>' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Irises </ENAMEX>' at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>auction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November 1987 </TIMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Bond </ENAMEX>. 
4251 -LRB- Trouble is , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond </ENAMEX>has yet to pay up , and until he does , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>has the painting under lock and key . -RRB- 
4361 When Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>moved in on the art market , he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>. 
4493 He established his reputation as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freespender </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January last year </TIMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>auction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Guterman </ENAMEX>collection in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>. 
4639 There , on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of his first shopping trips , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>picked up several paintings at stunning prices . 
4739 He paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 2 million </NUMEX>, for instance , for a still life by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Jansz . den Uyl </ENAMEX>that was expected to fetch perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 700 , 000 </NUMEX>. 
4859 The price paid was a record for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist </ENAMEX>. 
4903 -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Some 64 % </NUMEX>of items offered at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guterman </ENAMEX>auction were sold , at an average price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 343 , 333 </NUMEX>. 
4998 The rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids . -RRB- 
5052 Afterward , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>is said by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guterman </ENAMEX>to have phoned Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guterman </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer </ENAMEX>selling the collection , and gloated . 
5187 ` He says he ` stole them , ' ' recalls Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guterman </ENAMEX>. 
5237 ` And he tells me , ` If you want to see your paintings , you ' ll have to come to my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>. 
5335 ' ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>denies phoning and gloating . 
5376 ` It ' s just not true , ' he says . 
5409 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>quickly became more aggressive in his collecting , with the help of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Wachter </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert </ENAMEX>in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guterman </ENAMEX>items . 
5587 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wachter </ENAMEX>, who became his principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser </ENAMEX>, searched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">galleries </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Monaco </ENAMEX>. 
5682 And , according to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wachter </ENAMEX>had a penchant for introducing Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>with the phrase : ` He can buy anything . ' 
5806 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Hall </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colnaghi U . S . A . Ltd . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">gallery </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>, sold Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Abraham and Sarah in the Wilderness </ENAMEX>' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Battista Tiepolo </ENAMEX>. 
5966 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall </ENAMEX>says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>` was known to spend a lot of money . 
6025 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>were interested in seeing him , but it was recognized that the route was through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>and particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Wachter </ENAMEX>. ' 
6158 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>thus developed a close , symbiotic relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>. 
6230 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>was eager to assemble a collection for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>has been moving into for the greater part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year </TIMEX>. 
6357 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>, the auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house </ENAMEX>founded in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1744 </TIMEX>and now under the umbrella of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s Holdings Inc . </ENAMEX>, was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it strove to build its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business </ENAMEX>. 
6551 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>continued to dominate the action in old masters , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s North America </ENAMEX>had lately been touting in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>. 
6690 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several months </TIMEX>, there was optimism all around . 
6741 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last October </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>paid out <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 million </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>' s cash - - plus a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 2 million </NUMEX>commission - - for ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Portrait of a Man as Mars </ENAMEX>. ' 
6874 The painting , attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Flemish </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Paul Rubens </ENAMEX>, was purchased privately through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>, not at auction . 
6997 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 1989 </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">just 15 months </TIMEX>into his campaign , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>was named by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Art &amp; Antiques </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>as one of the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual </ENAMEX>collectors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
7148 ` An unknown quantity to most of the art world , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>is no stranger to lavish spending , ' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>said , noting that he does n't stop at paint on canvas but also spends big on art you can eat . 
7342 ` He recently bid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 , 000 </NUMEX>at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris </ENAMEX>charity auction for a dinner cooked by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six </NUMEX>of the world ' s great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chefs </ENAMEX>, but the final party cost closer to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 , 000 </NUMEX>. ' 
7495 -LRB- Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>says it was n't that high . -RRB- 
7534 The art collection might have come to rival the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medicis </ENAMEX>' had the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office </ENAMEX>not got wind of Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>' s aesthetic adventure . 
7678 In its letter to him , dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 2 </TIMEX>and shared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Hager </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief </ENAMEX>of the thrift - institution <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureau </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office </ENAMEX>, expressed puzzlement that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S &amp; L </ENAMEX>could be so profligate when it had reported losses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 13 million </NUMEX>in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two preceding quarters </TIMEX>. 
7968 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state </ENAMEX>gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 days </TIMEX>to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens </ENAMEX>. 
8020 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office </ENAMEX>eventually extended the deadline to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six months </TIMEX>but broadened its demands , ordering that the ` book value of the collection -LCB- be -RCB- reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero </NUMEX>. ' 
8190 In other words : Get rid of all the pictures . 
8235 The state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>and closed with the admonition to Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>: ` Govern yourself accordingly . ' 
8416 The state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency </ENAMEX>was particularly vexed to learn that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens </ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half - dozen </NUMEX>other paintings listed among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>' s ` furniture and fixtures , ' were actually hanging in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house </ENAMEX>. 
8613 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>says that at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>point he did indeed have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight </NUMEX>or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine </NUMEX>of the paintings at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home </ENAMEX>and that the rest were in storage at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>. 
8751 He explains that he was ` merely storing the paintings at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home </ENAMEX>- - with some display - - because of the special dehumidified environment ' required for their safekeeping , until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>' s new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building </ENAMEX>was ready for them . 
8968 Still , the incident was embarrassing . 
9008 It came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>has benefited handsomely from his association with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>. 
9155 For instance , he got a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 million </NUMEX>loan from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S &amp; L </ENAMEX>, negotiated at a below - market rate . 
9243 He owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>' s shares . 
9279 Adding to Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>' s problems , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>-LRB- some with vested interests -RRB- insist that he , relying rather too heavily on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>advice , paid much too much for several pieces in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>collection . 
9477 <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">The $ 12 million </NUMEX>lavished on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens </ENAMEX>, for example , was a record price for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist </ENAMEX>and maybe twice its value , given a dispute among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars </ENAMEX>about its provenance . 
9644 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Tunick </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">David Tunick Inc . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">gallery </ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars </ENAMEX>question the authenticity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens </ENAMEX>. 
9769 It may have been painted instead by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate </ENAMEX>. 
9827 ` The feeling among many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts </ENAMEX>on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tunick </ENAMEX>says . 
9963 ` It sounds like with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens </ENAMEX>he got absolutely taken to the cleaners . ' 
10039 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Wiener </ENAMEX>, the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Appraisers Association of America </ENAMEX>, agrees that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>paid very dearly for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens </ENAMEX>and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat . 
10259 ` It ' s not beyond credibility the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens </ENAMEX>will someday be worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 million </NUMEX>, but whether it could be sold for that amount <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow </TIMEX>remains to be seen . ' 
10411 Still , predicting is tricky . 
10440 ` I ' m forever dumbfounded by what I see making these high prices . ' 
10508 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan H . Kress </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son </ENAMEX>of the painting ' s former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner </ENAMEX>, Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rush Kress </ENAMEX>, dismisses the price talk as ` sour <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">grapes </ENAMEX>. ' 
10627 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers </ENAMEX>contemptuous of the purchase price , he says , were themselves interested in buying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens </ENAMEX>but lost out . 
10744 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>, for his part , defends the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens </ENAMEX>price , saying a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts </ENAMEX>have never seen the thing itself . 
10856 ` Most of them were n't even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly , ' he says . 
10951 Art prices are skyrocketing , but a good deal of legerdemain is involved in compiling statistics on sales . 
11057 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc . </ENAMEX>, the investment - banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>tally of investment returns , reported that old masters appreciated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ended June 1 </TIMEX>, the greatest return of any of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 </NUMEX>assets it tracked . 
11272 -LRB- Impressionist and modern paintings , not tracked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon </ENAMEX>, are ranked even higher at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74 % </NUMEX>by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>. -RRB- 
11380 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon </ENAMEX>, moreover , gets its data on art appreciation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>, whose prices go up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>like Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>in its thrall . 
11510 The percentages omit from consideration the many paintings that go begging at auction . 
11597 Art indexes track winners , not losers . 
11636 But art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale . 
11704 Also , at any of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>auctions of old masters , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly one - third to one - fifth </NUMEX>of what is offered does n't sell at any price . 
11832 It ' s not that there are n't any bids , but the bids do n't meet the minimum ` reserve ' prices set by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">sellers </ENAMEX>. 
11944 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preti </ENAMEX>painting that now hangs at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>was expected to bring <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">no more than $ 700 , 000 </NUMEX>at auction until Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>came along with his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 15 million </NUMEX>. 
12109 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colnaghi </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">gallery </ENAMEX>says <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 15 million </NUMEX>` would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preti </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">four years ago </TIMEX>. ' 
12245 But from his vantage point , it is n't that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer </ENAMEX>of his too , overpaid for the work , ` a gargantuan painting by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist </ENAMEX>who is not a household word . ' 
12409 -LRB- The painting is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">10 feet </NUMEX>wide , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">seven feet </NUMEX>high . -RRB- 
12458 Rather , ` It just shows things have changed . ' 
12505 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn . 
12599 ` They went up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, and they ' ll do it again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, ' he declares . 
12677 ` They were a sleeper . 
12699 Everybody was out buying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monets </ENAMEX>. ' 
12733 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana Levitt </ENAMEX>says the auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house </ENAMEX>has been ` assisting ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>in selling the paintings . 
12850 And while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals </ENAMEX>in the art world , private art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>, ` wo n't be happy to hear it , ' she adds , ` a number of -LCB- the artworks -RCB- have already been sold , and at a substantial profit . ' 
13043 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>claims to have sold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>paintings , at more than a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>profit . 
13116 That is n't <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 % </NUMEX>, and the claim is n't documented . 
13166 He furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>or Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wachter </ENAMEX>. 
13244 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>says he had not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers </ENAMEX>and that he never bid impulsively . 
13326 After all , he had the counsel of ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators </ENAMEX>from the most reputable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">museums </ENAMEX>in the world . ' 
13416 He says he expects to sell the collection - - including the controversial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens </ENAMEX>- - ` carefully and prudently , just as it was put together . ' 
13557 But in art - world parlance , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>' s holdings are ` burnt . ' 
13617 That is , he is being compelled to put them on the market too soon , and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works . 
13768 ` After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few years </TIMEX>, you can argue there has been natural appreciation , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Theran </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Leonard ' s Annual Price Index of Art Auctions .  
13922 But quick turnover in artwork is ` like pawning your jewelry - - you end up with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX>. 
14006 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>hold out and try to get a bargain . ' 
14051 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>defends itself and Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>in the matter . 
14104 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wachter </ENAMEX>says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment . 
14223 ` On occasion , he paid a high price , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wachter </ENAMEX>concedes , but he says those who bid less and dropped out were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>who would then have marked up the paintings to resell them at a profit to collectors . 
14430 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naomi Bernhard Levinson </ENAMEX>, a fine - arts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appraiser </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bernhard Associates </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX>, considers it ` definite conflict of interest for an auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house </ENAMEX>to both advise a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client </ENAMEX>on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased . ' 
14682 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>, she says , is ` wearing both hats . ' 
14729 ` I ca n't see why there would be a conflict of interest , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levitt </ENAMEX>. 
14813 ` Estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions , and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer </ENAMEX>could be . ' 
14996 Frequently , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>express interest in paintings but do n't end up bidding , she adds , ` so we do n't know who the potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer </ENAMEX>will be . ' 
15136 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>, in selling off his paintings , is seeking <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least a 15 % </NUMEX>return on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>' s investment , so as to prove that the venture was sound . 
15278 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>says that he has feelers out over much of the globe and that potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>from as far away as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy </ENAMEX>have examined the collection . 
15433 Because of the pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>to sell , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors </ENAMEX>have been trying to get the paintings at bargain - basement prices . 
15567 But so far , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers </ENAMEX>are holding fast . 
15625 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Zimet </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">French &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>, says he ` would have loved to buy ' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Davids de Heem </ENAMEX>painting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>. 
15758 ` I tried to steal the picture - - to buy it attractively - - and -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby ' s </ENAMEX>-RCB- would n't do it . 
15849 They were protecting his interests . ' 
15888 Meanwhile , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>are getting squeamish about opulence . 
15970 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>has been characterized as ` the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Great Gatsby </ENAMEX>or something , ' complains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen E . Brinkman </ENAMEX>, an executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>. 
16108 The media , she says , have distorted his personal life . 
16165 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>nods in agreement . 
16193 ` I do n't think I have a life style that is , frankly , so flamboyant , ' he says . 
16271 But at just that moment , he is interrupted in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant </ENAMEX>in tuxedo who pours <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee </ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver </ENAMEX>into a cup of china and dabs the brim with linen . 
16432 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>says , yes , the ceiling in his executive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">suite </ENAMEX>is gold - leaf inlay . 
16507 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices </ENAMEX>are done in hardwood and oriental rugs , leatherbound books and , of course , a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 million </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens </ENAMEX>. 
16616 But he implores that the splendor be played down . 
16668 ` Do n't say it ' s a gold ceiling . 
16700 Just say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices </ENAMEX>are tastefully appointed , ' he says . 
16757 ` Otherwise , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>will take it for decadence , and nowadays everything ' s got to be pristine . ' 
16861 Figures do n't include taxes or transaction costs .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Trade Representative </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla Hills </ENAMEX>said the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>dispute - settlement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel </ENAMEX>set up under the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U .

241 Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>have until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov . 13 </TIMEX>to resolve the dispute . 
320 If a solution is n't reached by then , she said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>equivalent in value to the losses suffered by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish </ENAMEX>- processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Pacific Northwest </ENAMEX>. 
557 However , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ottawa </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Trade </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Crosbie </ENAMEX>said the dispute - settlement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel </ENAMEX>accepted the ` legitimacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>' s position on the use of these landing requirements to conserve and manage these important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">fisheries </ENAMEX>. ' 
788 Questioned about the seeming contradiction in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX>government views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel </ENAMEX>' s report , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide </ENAMEX>for Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel </ENAMEX>had clearly ruled that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX>trade restrictions ` are illegal . ' 
1006 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative </ENAMEX>declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX>export restrictions . 
1135 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish </ENAMEX>had to be brought ashore in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">British Columbia </ENAMEX>by commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen </ENAMEX>prior to export . 
1322 This action was defended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>on conservation grounds . 
1401 Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills </ENAMEX>said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>that the dispute - settlement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel </ENAMEX>rejected this <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX>government argument . 
1505 ` We fully expect that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>will comply with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel </ENAMEX>' s ruling ' that the ` landing requirement ' also must be ended , she said . 
1634 Earlier , an international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel </ENAMEX>set up under the rules of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Geneva </ENAMEX>determined that the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX>fish - export restrictions violated <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GATT </ENAMEX>rules . 
1831 Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>wo n't accept any delays after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov . 13 </TIMEX>because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>fish - processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>enter into contracts in the fall to purchase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next season </TIMEX>' s catch . 
1999 She said the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX>restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allegheny Ludlum Corp . </ENAMEX>expects to report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 34 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 50 </NUMEX>a share , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38 . 4 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 70 </NUMEX>a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard P . Simmons </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>, told institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>. 
269 Sales for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer </ENAMEX>of specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steels </ENAMEX>and other materials fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 265 million </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 320 . 5 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>, he said . 
444 He said the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>estimate indicates profit for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months </TIMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 65 </NUMEX>a share , ` almost equal to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">full - year 1988 </TIMEX>earnings ' of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 108 . 6 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 81 </NUMEX>a share . 
617 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first nine months of 1988 </TIMEX>, net was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 85 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 76 </NUMEX>a share . 
692 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons </ENAMEX>said the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>results reflect continued improvements in productivity and operating margins . 
807 He said capital spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>will rise to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 45 million </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 35 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>.  

9 We ' re about to see if advertising works . 
52 Hard on the heels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 </NUMEX>- point stock - market plunge and the uncertainty that ' s followed , a few big brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market ' s just fine . 
273 Their mission is to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>from fleeing the market , as individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>did in droves after the crash in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October  
398 Just days after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash , major brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>rushed out ads to calm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>. 
486 This time around , they ' re moving even faster . 
534 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc . </ENAMEX>filmed a new television commercial at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 p . m . EDT </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>and had it on the air by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night </TIMEX>. 
647 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity Investments </ENAMEX>placed new ads in newspapers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, and wrote another new ad appearing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. 
750 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </ENAMEX>by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>had already written new TV ads . 
833 It considered running them during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night </TIMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series </ENAMEX>broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
963 Other brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, were plotting out potential new ad strategies . 
1066 The brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic . 
1207 This time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>were ready . 
1240 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>, for example , prepared ads <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several months ago </TIMEX>in case of a market plunge . 
1323 When the market went into its free fall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>, the investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>ordered full pages in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>editions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>. 
1471 The ads touted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>' s automated <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">800 </ENAMEX>- number beneath the huge headline , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call </ENAMEX>. ' 
1582 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>says the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">800 </ENAMEX>- line , which already was operating but which many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>did n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>. 
1758 ` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , ' he says . 
1845 ` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial . 
1895 It would have been too late to think about on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
1949 We had to think about it ahead of time . ' 
1992 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today </TIMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>ad goes a step further , encouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>to stay in the market or even to plunge in with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>. 
2113 Underneath the headline ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Diversification </ENAMEX>, ' it counsels , ` Based on the events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past week </TIMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market ' s volatility . ' 
2320 It goes on to plug a few diversified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>funds by name . 
2383 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber </ENAMEX>also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash . 
2454 In the aftermath of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>debacle , the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>began taping commercials in - house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that night </TIMEX>. 
2673 It also negotiated an arrangement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cable News Network </ENAMEX>under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>would agree to air its last - minute creations . 
2795 The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber </ENAMEX>commercial , created with ad agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co . </ENAMEX>, features <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Farrell </ENAMEX>, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>' s most visible investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists </ENAMEX>, sounding particularly bullish . 
2982 Taped just as the market closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, it offers Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farrell </ENAMEX>advising , ` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle . . . . 
3132 We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long - term appreciation . ' 
3228 The spot was scheduled to appear <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>times on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night </TIMEX>. 
3294 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber </ENAMEX>considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks . 
3368 Instead , it settled on just urging the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market . 
3472 ` We ' re saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lampe </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of advertising . 
3671 ` If you owned it and liked it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, the true value has n't changed . ' 
3741 He adds , ` This is n't <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>revisited . ' 
3781 With the market fluctuating and then closing up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 88 </NUMEX>points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>had to constantly revise their approach . 
3918 At Shearson Lehman , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>created potential new commercials <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night </TIMEX>and throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>, then had to regroup <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>. 
4065 The plan had been to make one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson </ENAMEX>' s easy - to - film , black - and - white ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Where We Stand </ENAMEX>' commercials , which have been running occasionally in response to news events since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985 </TIMEX>. 
4245 The ad would have run during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series </ENAMEX>tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson </ENAMEX>' s new ad campaign , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Leadership by Example </ENAMEX>. ' 
4390 But in a meeting after the market closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>decided not to go ahead with the stock - market ad . 
4512 ` We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said . 
4569 The market seems to be straightening out ; we ' re taking a wait - and - see attitude , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathleen B . Stewart </ENAMEX>, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC"> vice president </ENAMEX> of marketing . 
4717 In any case , the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>. 
4829 But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective . 
4901 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals </ENAMEX>ran from the market en masse . 
5018 Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around . 
5110 Ad Notes . . . . 
5128 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ARNOLD ADVERTISING </ENAMEX>: 
5148 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Eskandarian </ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Della Femina , McNamee WCRS </ENAMEX>\/ <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston </ENAMEX>, reached an agreement in principle to acquire a majority stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arnold Advertising </ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shop </ENAMEX>.

5787 A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">142 </NUMEX>- page ad supplement to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business Week </ENAMEX>' s special ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Corporate Elite </ENAMEX>' issue calls on business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>to use their clout to help solve the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s education crisis . 
5953 The supplement , the largest ever for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>, includes ads from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 </NUMEX>corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>and kicks off a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two - year </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business Week </ENAMEX>initiative on education .

152 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas </ENAMEX>real estate investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust </ENAMEX>last paid a dividend on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec . 31 , 1987 </TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 </NUMEX>a share . 
270 Despite continuing troubles with problem assets and nonperforming loans , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust </ENAMEX>said it expects to be able to maintain or increase the rate of distributions because of operations of joint - venture properties .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PepsiCo Inc . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>said he is ` more than comfortable with ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>' estimates that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>earnings rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least 98 cents to $ 1 </NUMEX>a share from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">91 cents </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year earlier </TIMEX>. 
196 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D . Wayne Calloway </ENAMEX>, also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, indicated that he expects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>to raise their forecasts for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>releases its earnings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. 
376 So far , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>have said they are looking for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 30 to $ 3 . 35 </NUMEX>a share . 
448 After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>' s announcement , that range could increase to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 35 to $ 3 . 40 </NUMEX>a share . 
529 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>said he also would be comfortable with that new range . 
597 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>, the soft - drink <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 90 </NUMEX>a share . 
649 Results for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>will include <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 40 cents </NUMEX>a share from the dilutive effects of snack - food and bottling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>acquisitions . 
779 In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57 . 125 </NUMEX>a share , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 125 </NUMEX>. 
894 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>sales are expected to increase <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 12 billion </NUMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year ' s third quarter </TIMEX>. 
1011 Domestic soft - drink bottler case sales are estimated to have risen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>- - well below the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 % to 5 % </NUMEX>growth of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">recent years </TIMEX>- - but about in line with the rest of the soft - drink industry . 
1222 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calloway </ENAMEX>blamed the slower volume on rainier weather , a dearth of new products in the industry and - - to a much lesser extent - - pricing . 
1364 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PepsiCo </ENAMEX>said its soft - drink prices were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2 % </NUMEX>higher in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>. 
1436 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calloway </ENAMEX>also noted that soft - drink volume rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a hefty 9 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year ' s third quarter </TIMEX>, making the comparison more difficult . 
1567 International soft - drink volume was up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 6 % </NUMEX>. 
1618 Snack - food tonnage increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a strong 7 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, while domestic profit increased in double digits , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calloway </ENAMEX>said . 
1750 Excluding the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>snack - food business acquired in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>, snack - food international tonnage jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 % </NUMEX>, with sales strong in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil </ENAMEX>. 
1902 Total snack - food profit rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % </NUMEX>. 
1938 Led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pizza Hut </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Taco Bell </ENAMEX>, restaurant earnings increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 25 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 % </NUMEX>sales increase . 
2056 Same - store sales for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pizza Hut </ENAMEX>rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 13 % </NUMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Taco Bell </ENAMEX>' s increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 % </NUMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain </ENAMEX>continues to benefit from its price - value strategy . 
2201 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Taco Bell </ENAMEX>has turned around declining customer counts by permanently lowering the price of its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">tacos </ENAMEX>. 
2303 Same store - sales for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken </ENAMEX>, which has struggled with increased competition in the fast - food chicken market and a lack of new products , rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1 % </NUMEX>. 
2471 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation </ENAMEX>, which has been slow to respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>' shifting tastes away from fried foods , has been developing a grilled - chicken product that may be introduced nationally at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of next year </TIMEX>. 
2675 The new product has performed well in a market test in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nev . </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calloway </ENAMEX>said . 
2768 After a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four - year </TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 . 7 billion </NUMEX>acquisition binge that brought a major soft - drink <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soda </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bottlers </ENAMEX>, a fast - food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain </ENAMEX>and an overseas snack - food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pepsi </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calloway </ENAMEX>said he does n't expect any major acquisition in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next year or so </TIMEX>. 
3017 But , ` You never can tell , ' he added , ` you have to take advantage of opportunities .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honeywell Inc . </ENAMEX>said it hopes to complete shortly the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>sales of shares in its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yamatake - Honeywell </ENAMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 280 million </NUMEX>. 
168 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>would n't disclose the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer </ENAMEX>of the initial <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 % </NUMEX>stake . 
236 Proceeds of the sale , expected to be completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week </TIMEX>, would be used to repurchase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 10 million </NUMEX>shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honeywell </ENAMEX>stock , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said . 
391 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honeywell </ENAMEX>said it is negotiating the sale of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yamatake - Honeywell </ENAMEX>, but indicated it intends to hold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 20 % </NUMEX>of the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>' s stock long term . 
560 A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 % </NUMEX>stake would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honeywell </ENAMEX>to include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yamatake </ENAMEX>earnings in its results . 
641 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honeywell </ENAMEX>previously said it intended to reduce its holding in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>as part of a restructuring plan which also calls for a reduction of dependence on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapons </ENAMEX>sales . 
822 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday </TIMEX>a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>was ` pleased with our progress ' in that regard and ` hopes to provide additional details soon . ' 
960 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honeywell </ENAMEX>said its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Defense and Marine Systems </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, resulting in lower operating profit for that business . 
1150 Overall , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honeywell </ENAMEX>reported earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 74 . 4 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 73 </NUMEX>a share , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the three months ended Oct . 1 </TIMEX>compared with a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 41 . 4 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">98 cents </NUMEX>a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
1333 The previous period ' s results included a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 108 million </NUMEX>pretax charge related to unrecoverable contract costs and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 . 3 million </NUMEX>pretax gain on real estate sales . 
1495 Sales for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter </TIMEX>were flat , at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 72 billion </NUMEX>. 
1555 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honeywell </ENAMEX>reported earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 212 . 1 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 92 </NUMEX>a share , compared with earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 47 . 9 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 13 </NUMEX>a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
1716 Sales declined slightly to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 17 billion </NUMEX>.  

9 Commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
119 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday </TIMEX>, the stock market ' s influence at first created nervousness . 
189 Later , however , it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors . 
322 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Gold </ENAMEX>, the traditional haven in times of financial crisis , continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar , rising <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early in the day </TIMEX>as the currency fell , and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered . 
538 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Copper </ENAMEX>and crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil </ENAMEX>reacted sharply to the concern that a crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy . 
673 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Copper </ENAMEX>fell and showed little rebound through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved . 
818 Crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil </ENAMEX>declined early , but as the stock market retained early gains , it , too , became stronger , ending with a small net loss . 
948 Trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar </ENAMEX>was nervous and showed small declines . 
1017 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">grain </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soybean </ENAMEX>prices rose slightly . 
1069 Livestock and meat prices , however , dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beef </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pork </ENAMEX>. 
1190 In commodity markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>: PRECIOUS <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">METALS </ENAMEX>: Futures prices were moderately higher as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gold </ENAMEX>gave up some of its early gains and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">platinum </ENAMEX>behaved independently , first falling and then later rising . 
1392 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Silver </ENAMEX>performed quietly . 
1418 The spot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October </TIMEX>gold price rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 367 . 30 </NUMEX>an ounce . 
1475 The more active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December </TIMEX>delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gold </ENAMEX>settled with a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 90 </NUMEX>an ounce at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 371 . 20 </NUMEX>, after trading <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as $ 374 </NUMEX>. 
1595 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">silver </ENAMEX>was up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 . 3 cents </NUMEX>an ounce at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 163 </NUMEX>. 
1648 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Platinum </ENAMEX>behaved more like an industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metal </ENAMEX>, easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy , but recovering later , as the stock market strengthened . 
1808 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Gold </ENAMEX>was nowhere the spectacular performer it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>. 
1889 For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>thing , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday </TIMEX>, precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late - in - the - day </TIMEX>nose dive , so it could n't react to it . 
2041 Back on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday , Oct . 16 , l987 </TIMEX>, the stock market declined during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>, and gold prices surged as the stock market fell . 
2163 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>contract <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day </TIMEX>rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 8 . 70 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as $ 471 . 60 </NUMEX>, and the more deferred positions , due to mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as late as March 1989 </TIMEX>, rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 9 . 60 </NUMEX>. 
2336 On <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 19 , 1987 </TIMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October </TIMEX>contract tacked on further gains , rising to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as $ 491 . 50 </NUMEX>for a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 20 </NUMEX>on top of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>advances , before giving up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 10 </NUMEX>of that at the close . 
2549 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday </TIMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October </TIMEX>gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 </NUMEX>was miniscule compared with that . 
2614 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Cardillo </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Josephthal &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>, said the gold market already had some good price - supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market . 
2824 ` What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardillo </ENAMEX>. 
2941 There ' s a good chance that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gold </ENAMEX>will retain its gains and rise further , he said . 
3022 He expects a drop in interest rates , which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising . 
3116 Finally , according to Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardillo </ENAMEX>, the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>merchandise trade deficit , when the figures are released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. 
3301 This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gold </ENAMEX>, he said . 
3374 ENERGY : 
3382 Worried that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 </NUMEX>- point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy , petroleum futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices . 
3593 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">West Texas Intermediate </ENAMEX>, closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 . 59 </NUMEX>a barrel for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November </TIMEX>delivery , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 cents </NUMEX>. 
3708 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude </ENAMEX>was due for a correction anyhow , following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several days </TIMEX>of significant gains . 
3811 But most market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers </ENAMEX>agreed that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
3934 Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong . 
4051 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries </ENAMEX>increased its production ceiling for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter </TIMEX>based on projections of robust demand . 
4196 So any bearish indicator , such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s precipitous drop in the stock market , sends shivers through the oil markets as well . 
4324 Indeed , after reacting early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the trading day </TIMEX>to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plummet , futures prices firmed up again as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>took note of the stock market ' s partial recovery <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
4497 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">COPPER </ENAMEX>: 
4505 Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved . 
4635 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December </TIMEX>contract declined <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 . 05 cents </NUMEX>a pound to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 2745 </NUMEX>. 
4697 Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">copper </ENAMEX>use . 
4858 But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">copper </ENAMEX>as word spread that a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three - month </TIMEX>strike at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Highland Valley </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">British Columbia </ENAMEX>was about over , according to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>. 
5057 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Highland Valley </ENAMEX>is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer </ENAMEX>and principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supplier </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>, which recently began seeking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">copper </ENAMEX>elsewhere as its inventories shrank . 
5208 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week </TIMEX>it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle , the contracting out of work by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
5345 Now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>said , only minor points remain to be cleaned up . 
5411 ` For all intents and purposes , an agreement appears to have been achieved , ' he said . 
5496 Copper inventories in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodity Exchange </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">warehouses </ENAMEX>rose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">516 tons </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">10 , 004 tons </NUMEX>. 
5603 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London Metal Exchange </ENAMEX>copper inventories <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>declined <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">13 , 575 tons </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">89 , 300 tons </NUMEX>. 
5692 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LME </ENAMEX>stocks decline was about as expected , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Comex </ENAMEX>gain was n't . 
5765 However , this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>said . 
5849 At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>point in futures trading , as the stock market firmed , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December </TIMEX>contract rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as $ 1 . 2965 </NUMEX>, but it was n't able to sustain the gain . 
6000 ` It was simply overbought , ' he said , and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices . 
6108 <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">COTTON </ENAMEX>: 
6116 Futures prices eased , more in reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Jerry </ENAMEX>than to any influence of the stock market . 
6217 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December </TIMEX>contract ended with a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0 . 22 cent </NUMEX>a pound , at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">74 . 48 cents </NUMEX>. 
6295 Technical considerations following the hurricane , which was a factor in the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, caused prices to decline <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Simon </ENAMEX>, cotton <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential - Bache Securities </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>. 
6502 Prices rose sharply <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>as the storm approached <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Louisiana </ENAMEX>, which is part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Mississippi Delta </ENAMEX>cotton - growing area . 
6634 However , after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane , prices began to slip <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon </ENAMEX>said . 
6748 That selling continued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>and kept prices under pressure , he said . 
6822 Colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>and the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Delta </ENAMEX>during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming weekend </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon </ENAMEX>said . 
6965 That has n't yet captured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>' attention , he added . 
7022 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">SUGAR </ENAMEX>: 
7029 Futures prices declined . 
7054 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March </TIMEX>contract was off <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0 . 32 cent </NUMEX>a pound at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13 . 97 cents </NUMEX>. 
7115 At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>point in early trading the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March </TIMEX>price rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as 14 . 22 cents </NUMEX>when the stock market recovered , but the price then fell back . 
7255 A price - depressing factor , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>said , was that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India </ENAMEX>, which had been expected to buy <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">around 200 , 000 tons </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar </ENAMEX>in the world market , did n't make any purchases . 
7424 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India </ENAMEX>recently bought <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">200 , 000 tons </NUMEX>and was expected to buy more , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>said . 
7507 Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India </ENAMEX>may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market . 
7609 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India </ENAMEX>may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar </ENAMEX>, it could buy at lower prices , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Ganes </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>. 
7801 At any rate , she added , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India </ENAMEX>needs the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar </ENAMEX>, so it will be in sooner or later to buy it . ' 
7896 FARM PRODUCTS : 
7911 The prices of cattle and hog futures contracts dropped sharply because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>speculated that the stock market plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>will linger in the minds of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supermarket </ENAMEX>, which would hurt demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beef </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pork </ENAMEX>. 
8198 The price of the hog contract for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October </TIMEX>delivery dropped its maximum permissible <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX>limit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 . 5 cents </NUMEX>a pound . 
8317 The prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering . 
8453 Earlier in the session , the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows . 
8531 A broad rally began when several major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">processors </ENAMEX>began buying futures contracts , apparently to take advantage of the price dip .  

9 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>and on all flights of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours </TIMEX>or less to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hawaii </ENAMEX>. 
191 The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours </TIMEX>or less . 
364 The exemption allowed on longer flights to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hawaii </ENAMEX>appears to be largely a face - saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">recent years </TIMEX>. 
616 By a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 </NUMEX>- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 </NUMEX>margin , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators </ENAMEX>initially rejected <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night </TIMEX>a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>provision covering all domestic flights . 
731 But the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six - hour </TIMEX>compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions . 
805 As a practical matter , flights from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West Coast </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hawaii </ENAMEX>would be covered as they are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>or on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Coast </ENAMEX>. 
1020 Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>, the ban has had aggressive support from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lautenberg </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . J . </ENAMEX>-RRB- , who has used his position as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Appropriations </ENAMEX>subcommittee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>to garner votes for the initiative . 
1224 The measure is attached to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 26 billion </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990 </TIMEX>transportation bill within Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lautenberg </ENAMEX>' s jurisdiction , and the final compromise is laced with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 205 million </NUMEX>in road projects earmarked by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>as well as funds sought by major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports </ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>. 
1510 From the outset , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow . 
1598 But the industry retains support in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership </ENAMEX>through the influence of grower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">North Carolina </ENAMEX>. 
1719 Majority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Whip </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Gray </ENAMEX>owes a political debt to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Southern </ENAMEX>agriculture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers </ENAMEX>for his rise in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat </ENAMEX>used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban . 
1940 Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of behind - the - scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>. 
2191 In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania </ENAMEX>who had voted against the panel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership </ENAMEX>on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>floor . 
2429 ` Anybody can vote as they want , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lehman </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla . </ENAMEX>-RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees </ENAMEX>. 
2528 ` But if you make a request , you should support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee </ENAMEX>. ' 
2593 Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Aviation Administration </ENAMEX>, the final bill promises to increase spending for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities </ENAMEX>and equipment by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, and total operations would rise to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 84 billion </NUMEX>- - a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 % </NUMEX>boost . 
2809 The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities </ENAMEX>account includes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million </NUMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>' s ambitious new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport </ENAMEX>, and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers </ENAMEX>representing established <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan </ENAMEX>and the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental </ENAMEX>. 
3099 Leery of the costs - - and , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics </ENAMEX>say , competition - - the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines </ENAMEX>have sought to gain leverage over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>. 
3223 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Air Corp . </ENAMEX>, which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental </ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Air Transport Association </ENAMEX>were prominent in the lobbying . 
3330 The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines </ENAMEX>had agreed to leases for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX>of the gates . 
3490 But this was rejected in favor of much looser language directing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department </ENAMEX>to review the costs of the first phase , expected to cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 billion </NUMEX>. 
3662 Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed to preserve <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 30 . 6 million </NUMEX>in controversial subsidies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers </ENAMEX>serving rural or isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports </ENAMEX>. 
3831 The sum is more than double what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>had approved for the program , but the list of qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports </ENAMEX>would be cut by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 </NUMEX>under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy . 
4026 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>previously cut <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
4074 The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>has been paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 200 </NUMEX>for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger </ENAMEX>in subsidies . 
4236 Among rail and highway accounts , the agreement provides <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 615 million </NUMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amtrak </ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 85 million </NUMEX>for capital improvements . 
4365 And federal - formula grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 625 billion </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million </NUMEX>more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last fiscal year </TIMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Flowers Industries Inc . </ENAMEX>said it will report a charge of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eight cents to 10 cents </NUMEX>a share for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its fiscal first quarter , ended Sept . 23 </TIMEX>, from the sale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bakeries </ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">High Point </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . C . </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Gadsden </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ala .  
215 The convenience - food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it sold the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bakeries </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mills Family Bakery </ENAMEX>for an undisclosed amount . 
320 It said the sales were part of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983 </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Trade Commission </ENAMEX>Consent Order . 
400 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year earlier </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Flowers </ENAMEX>had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal first - quarter </TIMEX>net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23 cents </NUMEX>a share , on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 170 . 4 million </NUMEX>.  

9 In what is believed to be the first cancellation of a loan to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4 </TIMEX>killings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing </ENAMEX>, an international bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">syndicate </ENAMEX>has terminated a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55 million </NUMEX>credit for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Shanghai </ENAMEX>property project . 
218 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">syndicate </ENAMEX>, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schroders Asia Ltd . </ENAMEX>, agreed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last November </TIMEX>to provide the loan to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asia Development Corp . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>property <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developer </ENAMEX>. 
356 But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several weeks ago </TIMEX>, in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing </ENAMEX>killings , the loan was canceled , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>close to the project . 
497 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asia Development </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schroders </ENAMEX>declined to comment on the move . 
563 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Lenders </ENAMEX>had doubts about the project even before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4 </TIMEX>, but the harsh crackdown , which caused many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses </ENAMEX>to reassess their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>transactions , ` gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>the out they wanted , ' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Shanghai </ENAMEX>venture . 
800 The decision to cancel the loan exemplifies the tough attitude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>have taken toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4 </TIMEX>. 
909 While some commercial lending has resumed , international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders </ENAMEX>remain nervous about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>' s economic troubles and foreign debt - - <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 billion </NUMEX>at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1988 </TIMEX>. 
1075 Many loans are being renegotiated , especially those tied to the hotel sector , which has been hit hard by a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">post - June 4 </TIMEX>tourism slump . 
1209 Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>view property - sector loans as particularly risky . 
1274 The canceled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Shanghai </ENAMEX>loan leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asia Development </ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>, saddled with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>- completed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 </NUMEX>- story apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building </ENAMEX>and heavy debts . 
1418 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>owes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 million </NUMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shui On Group </ENAMEX>, the project ' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractor </ENAMEX>, and a significant , though unspecified , amount in legal fees to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coudert Brothers </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources </ENAMEX>say . 
1622 The project , known as Lotus Mansion , has been mired in controversy . 
1690 When the loan agreement was announced , it was hailed as one of the first Western - style financing transactions ever used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>. 
1820 Unlike most loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>, there was no <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">guarantor </ENAMEX>. 
1880 Instead , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>secured a promise from state - owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Communications </ENAMEX>that it would lend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asia Development </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the entire $ 55 million </NUMEX>at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing . 
2076 The loan was to have matured in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">just two to three years </TIMEX>, as soon as construction was completed . 
2174 But in a letter sent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asia Development </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schroders </ENAMEX>said the loan was terminated because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developer </ENAMEX>had failed to deliver adequate financial data and pay certain fees to the loan - management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">committee </ENAMEX>on time , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>close to the project . 
2441 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Creditors </ENAMEX>involved in the project contend , however , that the termination actually had nothing to do with these technical violations . 
2576 Instead , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors </ENAMEX>say , the loan fell victim to nervousness about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>' s political turmoil , as well as to concern about the loan ' s security . 
2722 The bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">syndicate </ENAMEX>is made up mostly of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>, but it includes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>' s state - owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citic Industrial Bank </ENAMEX>. 
2839 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>in the syndicate sustained no monetary losses because none of the credit facility had been drawn down .  

9 Influential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Ways and Means Committee </ENAMEX>introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings - and - loan bailout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency </ENAMEX>can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>' s sale of sick <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts </ENAMEX>. 
253 The bill , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backers </ENAMEX>include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Rostenkowski </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill . </ENAMEX>-RRB- , would prevent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Resolution Trust Corp . </ENAMEX>from raising temporary working capital by having an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC </ENAMEX>- owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget . 
500 The bill intends to restrict the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>borrowings only , unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency </ENAMEX>receives specific congressional authorization . 
633 ` Such agency ` self - help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>borrowing , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fortney Stark </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>-RRB- , the bill ' s chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor </ENAMEX>. 
817 The complex financing plan in the S &amp; L bailout law includes raising <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 billion </NUMEX>from debt issued by the newly created <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC </ENAMEX>. 
939 This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit . 
1060 <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Another $ 20 billion </NUMEX>would be raised through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bonds , which pay lower interest rates . 
1154 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC </ENAMEX>also requires ` working ' capital to maintain the bad assets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts </ENAMEX>that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately . 
1292 That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 billion </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 166 billion </NUMEX>including interest over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years </TIMEX>. 
1455 ` It ' s a problem that clearly has to be resolved , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Cooke </ENAMEX>, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC </ENAMEX>. 
1554 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency </ENAMEX>has already spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 19 billion </NUMEX>selling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 </NUMEX>insolvent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S &amp; Ls </ENAMEX>, and it is likely to sell or merge <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600 </NUMEX>by the time the bailout concludes . 
1705 Absent other working capital , he said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC </ENAMEX>would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets . 
1856 ` We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , ' he said . 
1959 The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight . 
2027 The law does allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC </ENAMEX>to borrow from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 5 billion </NUMEX>at any time . 
2112 Moreover , it says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC </ENAMEX>' s total obligations may not exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 billion </NUMEX>, but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC </ENAMEX>holds . 
2323 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC </ENAMEX>' s working - capital plan , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Schumer </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . Y . </ENAMEX>-RRB- said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC Oversight Board </ENAMEX>has been remiss in not keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>informed . 
2548 ` That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ways and Means </ENAMEX>, which seems to me sort of draconian , ' he said . 
2663 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC </ENAMEX>is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Hill </ENAMEX>if they want that kind of flexibility . ' 
2780 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ways and Means Committee </ENAMEX>will hold a hearing on the bill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Tuesday </TIMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McClatchy Newspapers Inc . </ENAMEX>said improvements in advertising and subscription revenue led to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21 % </NUMEX>gain in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>profit to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 . 8 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">31 cents </NUMEX>a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 . 2 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
215 Sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 7 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 94 . 9 million </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 88 . 3 million </NUMEX>. 
276 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>also attributed improved performance to a lower effective tax rate and higher interest income . 
405 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months </TIMEX>, the newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain </ENAMEX>had almost a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 % </NUMEX>increase in profit to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23 . 6 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">83 cents </NUMEX>a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 . 2 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">68 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
562 Sales grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 7 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 279 . 1 million </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 261 . 3 million </NUMEX>. 
624 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McClatchy </ENAMEX>publishes the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>-RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bee </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tacoma </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wash . </ENAMEX>-RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">News Tribune </ENAMEX>, and other papers in Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>. 
743 In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 . 25 </NUMEX>a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents </NUMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Laidlaw Transportation Ltd . </ENAMEX>said it raised its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ADT Ltd . </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Bermuda </ENAMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29 . 4 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 % </NUMEX>. 
106 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Laidlaw </ENAMEX>declined to disclose the price the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toronto </ENAMEX>transportation and waste services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>paid for the additional shares , which he said were acquired ` over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the last couple of weeks </TIMEX>.

310 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Laidlaw </ENAMEX>would n't increase its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ADT </ENAMEX>beyond <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % </NUMEX>` without a great deal of thought ' because of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>takeover regulations that require a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>acquiring more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % </NUMEX>to extend an offer to the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>.

1395 The index closed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1385 . 72 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">203 . 56 </NUMEX>points . 
1446 By comparison , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>, the new index would have dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 . 4 % </NUMEX>, according to a projection by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>. 
1574 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors </ENAMEX>may have reacted so strongly to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>' s losing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 % </NUMEX>of its value in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash and its wake . 
1766 This time , however , many small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>may have been hurt by acting so swiftly . 
1848 ` They all went in the wrong direction , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andreas Insam </ENAMEX>, an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank in Liechtenstein </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch </ENAMEX>. 
1980 He said he told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>to buy selected <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German </ENAMEX>blue chips after they fell by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 % </NUMEX>. 
2075 After the opening was delayed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes </TIMEX>because of the crush of sell orders , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt </ENAMEX>' s normal <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two - hour </TIMEX>trading session was extended <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">75 minutes </TIMEX>to handle the heavy volume . 
2249 ` The beginning was chaotic , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Longley </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commerzbank AG </ENAMEX>. 
2327 ` It took <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three - quarters of an hour </TIMEX>before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market . ' 
2438 Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">investors </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bankers </ENAMEX>, many of whom spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night before </TIMEX>in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">offices </ENAMEX>watching <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Far Eastern </ENAMEX>markets , were cautiously optimistic after the mild <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 8 % </NUMEX>decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>stock prices . 
2636 ` Everybody was still confident , including most institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">investors </ENAMEX>. 
2708 That is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norbert Braeuer </ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hessische Landesbank </ENAMEX>. 
2878 Some big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions </ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>, began picking up lower - priced shares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday </TIMEX>, but most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>wanted to see what would happen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>before acting . 
3051 But even if Wall Street continues to stabilize , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>, which already was showing signs of weakness after the DAX had slipped from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1657 . 61 </NUMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 8 </TIMEX>. 
3327 Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany </ENAMEX>' s bluest chips took some of the biggest hits . 
3394 A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 . 3 % </NUMEX>drop for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mannesmann AG </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dresdner Bank AG </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 . 6 % </NUMEX>decline were especially problematic for their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">boards </ENAMEX>, whose plans for major rights issues in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November </TIMEX>could now be in jeopardy . 
3594 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dresdner Bank </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>said it hoped to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 . 2 billion marks </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 642 . 2 million </NUMEX>-RRB- by issuing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four million </NUMEX>shares at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">300 marks </NUMEX>each . 
3727 Yet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s market cropped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dresdner </ENAMEX>' s share price by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33 marks </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">309 marks </NUMEX>a share , leaving little incentive for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>to subscribe to the standing price unless the market recovers quickly . 
3927 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">LONDON </ENAMEX>: 
3935 Headed toward a record drop at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>stock market recouped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two - thirds </NUMEX>of its losses in the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>' s early rally . 
4073 The Financial Times - Stock Exchange 100 Share Index closed off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 . 5 </NUMEX>points , at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2163 . 4 </NUMEX>, its high for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>, after having plunged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">204 . 2 </NUMEX>points at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 : 49 p . m .  
4231 It was big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions </ENAMEX>such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Norwich Union Insurance Group </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scottish Amicable Investment Managers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard Life Assurance Co . </ENAMEX>that spearheaded the rally . 
4392 Attracted by low prices and encouraged by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>' s performance , they scooped up equities across the board . 
4503 Volume was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">959 . 3 million </NUMEX>shares , more than triple recent levels . 
4570 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">PARIS </ENAMEX>: 
4577 Late buying gave the Paris Bourse a parachute after its free fall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early in the day </TIMEX>. 
4661 The CAC General Index ended down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 . 4 % </NUMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">523 . 6 </NUMEX>, a drop of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 . 6 </NUMEX>points from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
4746 ` There was a volatility in the market that I have never seen before , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel Vigier </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>in brokerage firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cholet Dupont </ENAMEX>. 
4879 ` When Wall Street turned around shortly after the opening , there was panic buying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris </ENAMEX>. ' 
4974 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Brokers </ENAMEX>said that as the news spread that Wall Street was moving up , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>who had called to place sell orders changed their line in mid - conversation , ordering buys instead . 
5152 Trading was driven primarily by small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators </ENAMEX>, with large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions </ENAMEX>waiting on the sidelines until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late in the day </TIMEX>. 
5289 When Wall Street turned , however , the big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys </ENAMEX>entered the market , looking for bargains .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump </ENAMEX>, who faced rising doubt about his bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines </ENAMEX>parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp . </ENAMEX>even before a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines </ENAMEX>buy - out came apart <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, withdrew his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 . 54 billion </NUMEX>offer . 
192 Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>representing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>trying to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp . </ENAMEX>met with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>about reviving that purchase at a lower price , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">possibly around $ 250 </NUMEX>a share , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 65 billion </NUMEX>. 
391 But a lower bid could face rejection by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>. 
448 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>, who vowed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday </TIMEX>to ` go forward ' with the bid , said he was dropping it ` in light of the recent change in market conditions . ' 
587 He said he might now sell his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>stake , buy more shares , or make another offer at a lower price . 
687 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan </ENAMEX>real - estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer </ENAMEX>acted after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers </ENAMEX>failed to obtain financing for their earlier <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 </NUMEX>- a - share bid , which sparked a selling panic among that snowballed into a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 </NUMEX>- point drop <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . 
933 News about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>, whose shares never reopened after trading was halted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>announcement , sent both stocks nosediving in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>. 
1126 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56 . 875 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 222 . 875 </NUMEX>on volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 . 3 million </NUMEX>shares , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>declined by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 22 . 125 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 76 . 50 </NUMEX>as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 . 7 million </NUMEX>shares changed hands . 
1266 Together , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>stocks wreaked havoc among takeover stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>, and caused a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 3 % </NUMEX>drop in the Dow Jones Transportation Average , second in size only to the stock - market crash of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 19 , 1987 </TIMEX>. 
1465 Some said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s market debacle had given Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>deal . 
1631 After reaching an intraday high of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 107 . 50 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>disclosed his bid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 5 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>' s stock had retreated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as low as $ 97 . 75 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>. 
1774 Some takeover stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>had been betting against Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>because he has a record of disclosing stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>that are potential takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">targets </ENAMEX>, then selling at a profit without making a bid . 
1981 ` He still has n't proven his mettle as a big - league take - out <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist </ENAMEX>, ' said airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Murphy </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley &amp; Co .  
2108 ` He ' s done this thing where he ' ll buy a little bit of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>and then trade out of it . 
2198 He ' s written this book , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Art of the Deal </ENAMEX>. 
2244 ' Why does n't he just follow through on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of these things ? ' 
2308 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>withdrew his bid before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>, which is due to meet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow </TIMEX>, ever formally considered it . 
2417 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>had weighed a wide range of possible responses , from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy - outs that might have included either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>, a friendlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer </ENAMEX>such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">billionaire </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bass </ENAMEX>, or both . 
2645 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>had also sought to foil Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department </ENAMEX>to reject airline buy - outs . 
2824 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>tried to put the blame for the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>deal on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>, saying it was rushing through a bill to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>. 
2980 ` I believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>transaction , and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this past Friday </TIMEX>, ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>. 
3241 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>declined to comment , and Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>did n't respond to requests for interviews . 
3325 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>never said how much <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>stock he had bought , only that his holdings were ` substantial . ' 
3423 However , he only received federal clearance to buy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 15 million </NUMEX>of the stock on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 20 </TIMEX>, when the price rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 </NUMEX>a share to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 78 . 50 </NUMEX>. 
3564 Between then and his bid on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 5 </TIMEX>, the price fluctuated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 75 . 625 and $ 87 . 375 </NUMEX>. 
3652 In an attempt to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>that his bid was n't just ` a stock play , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>promised <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>to notify the market before selling any shares . 
3806 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>was trading at around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 84 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>before his withdrawal announcement , then immediately fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 76 </NUMEX>. 
3920 Assuming that he paid a rough average price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80 </NUMEX>a share , and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 76 . 50 </NUMEX>. 
4126 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Crandall </ENAMEX>might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline </ENAMEX>with a defensive transaction , such as the sale of stock to a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder </ENAMEX>or company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>. 
4375 However , other knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers </ENAMEX>said they believed Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps . 
4532 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>said they believed Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>, whose towering ego had been viewed by some as a reason to believe he would n't back out , might come back with a lower bid . 
4698 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Neidl </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dillon Read &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>` is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle . 
4798 I ' m sure he still wants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>. ' 
4830 But others remained skeptical . 
4861 ` I was never sure <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump </ENAMEX>really wanted to take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Mattis </ENAMEX>, a bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .  
4986 ` What happened with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United </ENAMEX>was a gracious way for him to bow out . ' 
5053 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>never obtained financing for his bid . 
5103 That skepticism would leave him with an even greater credibility problem should he return that would handicap him in any effort to oust the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>in a proxy fight . 
5269 Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase Manhattan Corp . </ENAMEX>, the two lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders </ENAMEX>on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>buy - out , met with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy - out at a lower price . 
5467 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials </ENAMEX>familiar with the talks said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp </ENAMEX>had discussed lowering the offer to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 </NUMEX>a share , but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made . 
5643 At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 </NUMEX>a share , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>would have to borrow <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 6 . 1 billion </NUMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>. 
5722 The first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>deal unraveled after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citibank </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase </ENAMEX>could n't raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 . 2 billion </NUMEX>. 
5805 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citibank </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase </ENAMEX>had agreed to commit <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion </NUMEX>, and said they were ` highly confident ' of raising another <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 2 billion </NUMEX>. 
5930 Together , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase </ENAMEX>received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million </NUMEX>in fees to raise the rest of the financing . 
6023 But other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>was willing to pay them . 
6127 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials </ENAMEX>familiar with the bank talks said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>buy - out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>- - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways PLC </ENAMEX>- - is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest , but is n't likely to boost its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 965 million </NUMEX>equity contribution . 
6366 Nor is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>likely to come forward with a revised offer within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next 48 hours </TIMEX>despite the hopes of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>. 
6487 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers </ENAMEX>want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>time around . 
6587 Even if the buy - out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>is able to obtain financing , the transaction still faces obstacles . 
6683 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>could reject the new price as too low , especially since there are n't any competing bids . 
6784 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis </ENAMEX>, whose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 275 </NUMEX>- a - share offer was rejected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>, has n't shown signs of pursuing a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 </NUMEX>- a - share back - up bid he made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>. 
6953 In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">coalition </ENAMEX>of labor and management , longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies </ENAMEX>who joined forces only under the threat of Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis </ENAMEX>' s bid , could break apart now . 
7105 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>' s resilience gets its first test <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 </NUMEX>top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot </ENAMEX>union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>convene outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>in a previously scheduled meeting . 
7245 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Union </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F . C . -LRB- Rick -RRB- Dubinsky </ENAMEX>faces the tough task of explaining why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>refused to finance a buy - out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>approved overwhelmingly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>. 
7404 The pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union </ENAMEX>is vowing to pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides . 
7483 But if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>rejects a reduced bid and decides to explore other alternatives , it could transform what has been a harmonious process into an adversarial one . 
7646 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots </ENAMEX>could play hardball by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">airplanes </ENAMEX>. 
7779 If they were to insist on a low bid of , say <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 </NUMEX>a share , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>might n't be able to obtain a higher offer from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidders </ENAMEX>because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>might hesitate to finance a transaction the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots </ENAMEX>oppose . 
7983 Also , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Wolf </ENAMEX>and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>have joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots </ENAMEX>' bid , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidders </ENAMEX>. 
8179 That could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidder </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reynolds Metals Co . </ENAMEX>said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>net income dropped nearly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 123 . 7 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 10 </NUMEX>a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 137 . 2 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 56 </NUMEX>a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
170 The latest earnings reflect an increase of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5 . 5 million </NUMEX>in common shares outstanding . 
261 Revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 52 billion </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 48 billion </NUMEX>. 
316 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reynolds </ENAMEX>is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX>big aluminum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>to report disappointing earnings . 
406 The No . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 </NUMEX>domestic aluminum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aluminum Co . of America </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>said its earnings fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 . 2 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 219 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 46 </NUMEX>a share . 
539 And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alcan Aluminium Ltd . </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>reported net income slid <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 180 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">77 cents </NUMEX>a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 258 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 07 </NUMEX>a share . 
678 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>on average had been expecting <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 . 70 </NUMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alcoa </ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 </NUMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alcan </ENAMEX>. 
759 ` It ' s a good indication that level of profitability has peaked for the industry , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vahid Fathi </ENAMEX>, metals <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prescott , Ball &amp; Turben Inc . </ENAMEX>, who had estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reynolds </ENAMEX>would earn <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 . 35 </NUMEX>a share . 
970 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s No . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 </NUMEX>aluminum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said earnings were hurt by lower prices for certain fabricated aluminum products , which typically follow price fluctuations of primary ingots . 
1149 The base metal price has dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 . 3 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">78 cents </NUMEX>a pound . 
1229 Much of the price decline has been blamed on a slowing economy and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>is typically the industry ' s slowest period . 
1360 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William O . Bourke </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>, said the ingot price ` appears to have bottomed out . ' 
1474 He said shipments are continuing at a ` healthy ' pace and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>has no excess inventory . 
1568 Aluminum shipments of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">329 , 600 metric tons </NUMEX>were nearly equal to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year - earlier </TIMEX>period , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said . 
1676 Nevertheless , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter </TIMEX>there were increased material and labor costs , including a new employee profit - sharing plan . 
1829 In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reynolds </ENAMEX>closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55 . 375 </NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 25 </NUMEX>.  

9 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday </TIMEX>was , in the words of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J .

163 When it was all over and stocks had staged a huge recovery , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>were self - congratulatory about how well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>had gone . 
301 They said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>' s trading procedures , personnel , equipment and links with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>could n't have performed better . 
432 ` We had no operating problems at all , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan </ENAMEX>said after the market closed . 
512 ` All the things that we set up to slow down the process , to let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>know that the market was in an extreme position , worked extremely well . ' 
658 Prices for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">416 . 3 million </NUMEX>shares that changed hands during the session were carried on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>' s trading tape with barely a delay , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>said . 
813 While reaching blockbuster proportions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, the volume was still well within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600 million </NUMEX>- share capacity that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>has said it can handle <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX>since beefing up its computers after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>crash . 
1037 The so - called circuit breakers devised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange </ENAMEX>to quell free falls in stock and futures prices were n't triggered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>because the markets were higher for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>. 
1260 Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>' complaints , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan </ENAMEX>said the links with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>futures market worked as planned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s rout to provide a cooling - off period . 
1415 Of greater help , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>said , was the ` natural circuit breaker ' of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>, that provided a breathing period that ` brought rationality back to the market .  

9 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Communications Workers of America </ENAMEX>ratified a new regional contract and all but one of the local agreements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell Atlantic Corp .  
147 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CWA </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">New Jersey Commercial </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">local </ENAMEX>, which represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2 , 500 </NUMEX>service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives </ENAMEX>and marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>, rejected the tentative agreement . 
294 Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union </ENAMEX>and the regional telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said they were working together to resolve differences . 
402 The new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three - year </TIMEX>contracts , which replace ones that expired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug . 5 </TIMEX>, cover <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell Atlantic </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>. 
510 The ratification follows a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">23 - day </TIMEX>strike against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
593 Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CWA </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>remain on strike against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nynex Corp . </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>- based regional phone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
749 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>agreed to mediation . 
807 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CWA </ENAMEX>represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nynex </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IBEW </ENAMEX>represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>.  

9 A seat on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade </ENAMEX>was sold for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 390 , 000 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 , 000 </NUMEX>from the previous sale <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Tuesday </TIMEX>. 
120 Seats currently are quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 353 , 500 </NUMEX>bid , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 405 , 000 </NUMEX>asked . 
182 The record price for a full membership on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 550 , 000 </NUMEX>, set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug . 31 , 1987 </TIMEX>. 
271 An associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member </ENAMEX>seat was sold for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 228 , 000 </NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 , 000 </NUMEX>from the previous sale <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 4 </TIMEX>.

441 The record price for associate membership is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 275 , 000 </NUMEX>, set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug . 30 , 1988 </TIMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bay Financial Corp . </ENAMEX>, hurt by high debts and deteriorating real estate investments , reported a wider loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter </TIMEX>and said it might be forced to seek a bankruptcy - court reorganization if it ca n't renegotiate its borrowings . 
249 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bay </ENAMEX>said a ` substantial part ' of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower - than - expected prices for sales made . 
424 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said its real estate portfolio is ` highly leveraged , ' while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two - thirds </NUMEX>of its investments are n't income - producing . 
557 Thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments . 
699 According to its latest annual report , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a quarter </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s holdings are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Massachusetts </ENAMEX>, in the midst of a real - estate slump . 
841 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it had a net loss in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its fourth quarter ended June 30 </TIMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36 . 2 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 . 33 </NUMEX>a share , on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13 . 1 million </NUMEX>. 
977 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year earlier </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>had a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 . 8 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 04 </NUMEX>a share , on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 . 8 million </NUMEX>. 
1081 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year </TIMEX>, it had a net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 62 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 . 97 </NUMEX>a share , on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44 . 3 million </NUMEX>. 
1177 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous year </TIMEX>, it had a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 22 . 5 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 . 52 </NUMEX>a share , on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 41 . 1 million </NUMEX>. 
1280 Although it is having serious cash - flow problems , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bay </ENAMEX>said the fair - market value of its holdings , minus debt , was equal to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 . 02 </NUMEX>a share at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 30 </TIMEX>based on a recent appraisal . 
1457 Book value per share , which is based on investments at cost , was a negative <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 . 69 </NUMEX>a share . 
1548 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year earlier </TIMEX>, fair - market value per share was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26 . 02 </NUMEX>and book value was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 . 43 </NUMEX>a share .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Business Computer Corp . </ENAMEX>said it privately placed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 035 , 000 </NUMEX>common shares at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 50 </NUMEX>a share . 
111 The placement was made through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gray Seifert Securities </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>, to institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>. 
205 Proceeds will be used to commercialize recently patented technology and support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s international expansion . 
324 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>develops and markets products for the food service industry .  

9 The market for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 billion </NUMEX>of high - yield junk bonds regained some of its footing as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge . 
161 But the junk recovery , led by the bellwether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Holdings </ENAMEX>bonds , was precarious . 
242 No trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds , securities industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>said . 
334 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>fled and brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>were unwilling to provide bid and offer prices for most issues . 
508 ` Nothing traded on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>were n't really sure where the market should have opened ' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Minella </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co - head </ENAMEX>of merchant banking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co .  
687 ` But we had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a fairly active day </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. ' 
733 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . </ENAMEX>, the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriter </ENAMEX>of junk bonds , ` I was prepared to be in a very bad mood <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight </TIMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Feinman </ENAMEX>, a junk bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>. 
895 ` Now , I feel maybe there ' s a little bit of euphoria . ' 
949 But before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell - off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, he said , ` You could n't buy -LCB- junk bonds -RCB- and you could n't give them away . ' 
1102 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday </TIMEX>' s rally was led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Holdings </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 3 \/ 4 % </NUMEX>bonds , which initially tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>points , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 </NUMEX>for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 , 000 </NUMEX>face amount , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96 1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>before rebounding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>. 
1272 Bonds issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kroger </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Duracell </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Safeway </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Standard </ENAMEX>also showed big gains , recovering almost all their losses from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early yesterday </TIMEX>. 
1429 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>said the junk bond market increasingly is separating into a top - tier group , in which trades can be executed easily , and a larger group of lower - quality bonds in which liquidity - - or the ability to trade without too much difficulty - - has steadily deteriorated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
1715 ` Liquidity has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minella </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill </ENAMEX>. 
1815 ` The deadbeats are still deadbeats , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feinman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel </ENAMEX>. 
1882 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>are concerned that much of the high - yield market will remain treacherous for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>. 
1979 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Asquith </ENAMEX>, associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Massachusetts Institute of Technology </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Sloan School of Management </ENAMEX>, citing a pattern of junk - bond default rates that are low in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early years </TIMEX>after issuance and rise later , says , ` We ' re now in a period where we ' re starting to see defaults from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the big issue years of 1984 to 1986 </TIMEX>. ' 
2306 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Bachmann </ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor ' s Corp . </ENAMEX>, confirms that there is ` increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market . ' 
2471 ` Junk bonds are a highly stratified market , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Glucksman </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney , Harris Upham &amp; Co .  
2588 ` There ' s a whole bunch of stuff that ' s money good and a whole bunch of stuff that ' s not so good . ' 
2688 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor ' s </ENAMEX>say junk bond offerings by ` tightly stretched ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuers </ENAMEX>seem to be growing . 
2793 <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Almost $ 8 billion </NUMEX>of junk bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gillette Holdings </ENAMEX>-LRB- not related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gillette Co . </ENAMEX>-RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interco </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seaman Furniture </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allied Stores </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federated Department Stores </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Gypsum </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">M . D . C . Holdings </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Micropolis </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Leaseway Transportation </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Price Communications </ENAMEX>. 
3103 ` You could still have some very bad times ahead , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bachmann </ENAMEX>. 
3172 ` It ' s possible to have a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>default rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one year </TIMEX>, because we ' re already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy . 
3310 I ' m certainly not comfortable saying we ' ve seen the bottom . ' 
3373 But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s rally among ` good ' junk was a badly needed tonic for the market . 
3454 Many issues ` bounced off the floor , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minella </ENAMEX>said , and benchmark junk issues ` recovered all of their losses ' from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early yesterday </TIMEX>. 
3600 In contrast , he says , ` The stock market gained back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about half </NUMEX>what it lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, and the -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>-RCB- bond market lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half </NUMEX>what it gained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. ' 
3764 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s rally was fueled by insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>looking for bargains after a drastic slide in prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past month </TIMEX>. 
3898 In addition , mutual funds did n't appear to be major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers </ENAMEX>of high - yield securities as was expected . 
4002 ` Sometimes a shakeout is healthy , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel </ENAMEX>' s Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feinman </ENAMEX>. 
4064 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>will learn to be more circumspect . 
4107 If they do good credit analysis , they will avoid the hand <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">grenades </ENAMEX>. 
4175 I think the market is in good shape .  

9 A federal appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>struck down a natural - gas regulation that had prevented pipeline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>from passing to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>part of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion </NUMEX>in costs from controversial ` take - or - pay ' contracts . 
208 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>, in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 </NUMEX>- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 </NUMEX>ruling , threw out a deadline set by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission </ENAMEX>for settling old contract disputes over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas </ENAMEX>that the pipeline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>reserved but did n't use . 
404 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FERC </ENAMEX>' s regulation had given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">pipelines </ENAMEX>until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 31 , 1989 </TIMEX>, to pass on to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>as much as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX>of the costs of buying out their broken contracts , which were made with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers </ENAMEX>when gas prices were high and supplies short . 
633 A majority of old contracts were renegotiated by the deadline and settled at steep discounts . 
727 But pipeline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>estimate they still face <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 4 billion </NUMEX>in liabilities from unresolved disputes , including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion </NUMEX>they fear they wo n't be able to pass on to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>. 
906 According to industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers </ENAMEX>, the ruling gives pipeline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>an important <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost - sharing mechanism . 
1080 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>left open whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FERC </ENAMEX>could reimpose a new deadline later . 
1152 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>, agreeing with pipeline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>, found the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 31 </TIMEX>deadline was ` arbitrary and capricious ' and ` highly prejudicial to the bargaining power of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">pipelines </ENAMEX>' that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old take - or - pay contracts to meet the deadline . 
1416 A report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interstate Natural Gas Association of America </ENAMEX>found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">pipelines </ENAMEX>' settlement costs had jumped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the three months </TIMEX>before the deadline to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">39 cents </NUMEX>on the dollar , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22 cents </NUMEX>on the dollar in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>. 
1645 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FERC </ENAMEX>to justify within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">60 days </TIMEX>not only its cost - sharing deadline , but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural - gas transportation . 
1848 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>also questioned a crediting mechanism that could be used to resolve take - or - pay liabilities . 
1953 The complex regulation , known in the industry as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Order 500 </ENAMEX>, has been hotly contested by all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sides </ENAMEX>, including natural - gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">pipelines </ENAMEX>, local distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>. 
2140 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>' s decision would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FERC </ENAMEX>to change some of its provisions , but ensures it will be reviewed again quickly by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>.  

9 Once again , your editorial page misstates the law to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions . 
110 In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael S . Greve </ENAMEX>informs your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers </ENAMEX>, ` . . . the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Water Act </ENAMEX>is written upon the presumption - - the pretense , rather - - that nothing but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero </NUMEX>risk will do ; it establishes a legal standard of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero </NUMEX>discharge ' -LRB- ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Congress ' s Environmental Buccaneers </ENAMEX>, ' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 18 </TIMEX>-RRB- . 
488 This statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive , but it is simply wrong . 
633 The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Water Act </ENAMEX>contains no ` legal standard ' of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero </NUMEX>discharge . 
701 It requires that ` discharges of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">pollutants </ENAMEX>' into the ` <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">waters </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States </ENAMEX>' be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 301 </ENAMEX>. 
876 Whatever may be the problems with this system , it scarcely reflects ` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero </NUMEX>risk ' or ` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero </NUMEX>discharge . ' 
979 Perhaps Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greve </ENAMEX>was confused by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>' s meaningless statement of ` the national goal ' in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 101 </ENAMEX>, which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges - - by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985 </TIMEX>, no less . 
1159 This fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972 </TIMEX>, and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute . 
1307 Thus , you do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public </ENAMEX>a great disservice when Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greve </ENAMEX>suggests , even facetiously , that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Water Act </ENAMEX>prohibits the preparation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">scotch </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water </ENAMEX>; your tippling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers </ENAMEX>may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them , as they cower in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night </TIMEX>with their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">scotch </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">waters </ENAMEX>, from the hairyknuckled knock of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sierra Club </ENAMEX>at their doors . 
1686 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J . McManus  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hydro - Quebec </ENAMEX>said it notified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Central Maine Power Co . </ENAMEX>it will cancel a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion </NUMEX>contract to supply electricity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utility </ENAMEX>. 
146 The provincially owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utility </ENAMEX>said it is tearing up the deal because ` the contract ' s objectives ca n't be fulfilled . ' 
264 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hydro - Quebec </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>' refusal to approve the contract <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year </TIMEX>halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine </ENAMEX>to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities </ENAMEX>. 
477 ` It would now be physically impossible to begin deliveries in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992 </TIMEX>, ' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hydro - Quebec </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>said . 
576 The contract was to run from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992 </TIMEX>to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2020 </TIMEX>. 
621 Under the contract <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hydro - Quebec </ENAMEX>was to supply <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:ENERGY">400 megawatts </NUMEX>of power to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Central Maine Power </ENAMEX>starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992 </TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:ENERGY">600 megawatts </NUMEX>starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1995 </TIMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:ENERGY">900 megawatts </NUMEX>starting in 
794 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hydro - Quebec </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>' refusal to approve the contract means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Central Maine Power </ENAMEX>has lost its place in line . 
916 ` We wo n't sign any new contracts -LCB- with deliveries -RCB- beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier than 2000 </TIMEX>, ' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hydro - Quebec </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>said . 
1029 He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hydro - Quebec </ENAMEX>already has some ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>in mind ' for the power that was to be delivered to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine </ENAMEX>. 
1136 ` Nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hydro - Quebec </ENAMEX>was the lowest - cost , most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>' energy needs through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year 2020 </TIMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Central Maine </ENAMEX>senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald F . Kelly </ENAMEX>. 
1427 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Central Maine </ENAMEX>said it is evaluating ` many energy options ' to make up for the lost future power , including new energy generation and management proposals from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">New England </ENAMEX>, and possibly new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX>purchases .  

9 a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic , not unheroic , though sadly self - deceived <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">English </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butler </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">his sixties </TIMEX>- - proceeds as if the realistic <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">English </ENAMEX>novel of manners , like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britannia </ENAMEX>herself , still ruled the waves . 
226 In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kazuo Ishiguro </ENAMEX>' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Remains of the Day </ENAMEX>' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Knopf </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">245 </NUMEX>pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18 . 95 </NUMEX>-RRB- is both an homage to traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">English </ENAMEX>forms and a dramatic critique of them . 
384 It implies that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">British Empire </ENAMEX>was rooted in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects </ENAMEX>' minds , manners and morals , and argues , tacitly , that its self - destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery , willful blindness , role - playing and especially the locutions of its domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants </ENAMEX>. 
657 As the narrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens </ENAMEX>, the solitary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butler </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Darlington Hall </ENAMEX>, mulls over such hallowed terms as ` greatness , ' ` dignity , ' ` service ' and ` loyalty , ' we see how pious cant subverts the soul . 
846 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens </ENAMEX>' s dutiful conflation of the public and private realms - - like his beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master </ENAMEX>' s - - destroys all it was designed to preserve . 
982 Such armor crushes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier </ENAMEX>. 
1014 The mask cuts to the quick . 
1044 It ' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1956 </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year </TIMEX>the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Suez </ENAMEX>crisis marked the final end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Empire </ENAMEX>. 
1112 As he stands on a hill at the beginning of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six - day </TIMEX>motor expedition from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oxfordshire </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cornwall </ENAMEX>, where a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housekeeper </ENAMEX>resides , perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim </ENAMEX>of an unhappy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 - year </TIMEX>marriage , perhaps -LRB- he hopes with more fervor than he will ever acknowledge -RRB- not disinclined to return to domestic service , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens </ENAMEX>surveys the view and thereby provides a self - portrait , a credo and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author </ENAMEX>' s metaphor for the aesthetic of the novel we ' re reading : 
1557 ` We call this land of ours <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Great Britain </ENAMEX>, and there may be those who believe this a somewhat immodest practice . 
1669 Yet I would venture that the landscape of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective . . . . 
1782 It is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart . 
1872 What is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty , its sense of restraint . 
1946 It is as though the land knows of its own beauty , of its own greatness , and feels no need to shout it . 
2049 In comparison , the sorts of sights offered in such places as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Africa </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America </ENAMEX>, though undoubtedly very exciting , would , I am sure , strike the objective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer </ENAMEX>as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness . ' 
2273 An effusive landscape ? 
2296 An ill - mannered mountain ? 
2322 But let <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens </ENAMEX>continue in his unwitting comic manner -LRB- his conscious efforts at ` banter ' always fail - - most comically -RRB- : ` This whole question is very akin to the question that has caused much debate in our profession over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years </TIMEX>: what is a ` great ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butler </ENAMEX>? ' 
2583 His answer is one ` possessed of a dignity in keeping with his position . ' 
2656 Such dignity ` has to do crucially with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butler </ENAMEX>' s ability not to abandon the professional being he inhabits . ' 
2766 He ` will not be shaken out by external events , however surprising , alarming or vexing . . . . 
2859 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Continentals </ENAMEX>are unable to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butlers </ENAMEX>because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">English </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race </ENAMEX>are capable of . ' 
3009 Despite his racial advantage , to be a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butler </ENAMEX>is a heroic calling ; one ' s pantry is ` not unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters </ENAMEX>during a battle . ' 
3150 If , for example , in the midst of a great social occasion -LRB- such as an international conference on revising the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles Treaty </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1923 </TIMEX>-RRB- , one ' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">72 - yearold </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father </ENAMEX>, himself a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butler </ENAMEX>once , should happen to die of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke </ENAMEX>, one must continue to serve the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">port </ENAMEX>: ` Please do n't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father </ENAMEX>in his deceased condition just at this moment . 
3533 You see , I know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father </ENAMEX>would have wished me to carry on just now . ' 
3603 It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens </ENAMEX>to declare : ` For all its sad associations , whenever I recall <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that evening </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>, I find I do so with a large sense of triumph . ' 
3792 We note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow . 
3863 That <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens </ENAMEX>himself is not grotesque or repellent , but funny and sad and enlightening , is entirely the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author </ENAMEX>' s triumph . 
3987 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ishiguro </ENAMEX>' s ability to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic , cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">An Artist of the Floating World </ENAMEX>, ' set in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>after the war . 
4240 Now shifting his scene from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>he left at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">five </TIMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">England </ENAMEX>he has lived in for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">nearly 30 years </TIMEX>, he has fashioned a novel in the mode of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry James </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E . M . Forster </ENAMEX>. 
4418 With great aplomb he considers not only filial devotion and -LRB- utterly repressed -RRB- sexual love , but <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>anti - Semitism , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentry </ENAMEX>' s impatience with democracy and support of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler </ENAMEX>, and the moral problematics of loyalty : ` It is , in practice , simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude towards an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employer </ENAMEX>and at the same time provide good service . . . . 
4783 ` This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employer </ENAMEX>embodies all that I find noble and admirable . 
4844 I will hereafter devote myself to serving him . 
4891 ' This is loyalty intelligently bestowed . ' 
4936 In the end , after meeting with the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housekeeper </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens </ENAMEX>sits by the seashore at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dusk </TIMEX>, thinking of her and of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employer </ENAMEX>, and declares ` I trusted . 
5091 I trusted in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lordship </ENAMEX>' s wisdom . . . . 
5133 I ca n't even say I made my own mistakes . 
5174 Really - - one has to ask oneself - - what dignity is there in that ? ' 
5242 The loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant </ENAMEX>has come full circle . 
5282 What is greatness ? 
5301 What is dignity ? 
5318 We understand such rueful wisdom must be retrospective : The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">owl </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minerva </ENAMEX>only spreads her wings at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dusk </TIMEX>. 
5425 But as ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Remains of the Day </ENAMEX>' so eloquently demonstrates with quiet virtuosity , such wisdom can be movingly embodied in art . 
5554 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke </ENAMEX>teaches English and comparative literature at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Columbia University </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CAE Industries Ltd . </ENAMEX>said its Link Flight Simulation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division </ENAMEX>was awarded a contract by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . S . Army </ENAMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>helicopter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">simulators </ENAMEX>, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as 37 million Canadian dollars </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US $ 31 . 5 million </NUMEX>-RRB- . 
229 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CAE </ENAMEX>said the fixed price for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">AH - 64 Apache </ENAMEX>combat mission <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">simulators </ENAMEX>is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C $ 19 million </NUMEX>. 
331 It is scheduled for delivery in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1991 </TIMEX>. 
374 The price of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">simulator </ENAMEX>ranges <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between C $ 16 . 4 million and C $ 18 million </NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CAE </ENAMEX>said , depending on when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army </ENAMEX>exercises its option . 
517 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CAE </ENAMEX>is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toronto </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of commercial and military aircraft <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">simulators </ENAMEX>and training equipment .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic </ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth </NUMEX>- largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>, is attracting more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers </ENAMEX>than ever and offers the glossy , high - toned pages that upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>love . 
173 So why did advertising pages plunge by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 10 % </NUMEX>and ad revenue by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 2 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half </TIMEX>? 
267 To hear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>tell it , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>just has n't kept up with the times . 
345 Despite renewed interest by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public </ENAMEX>in such topics as the environment and the Third World , it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys </ENAMEX>like to flip through in search of topless tribe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women </ENAMEX>. 
557 Worse , it lagged behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>in offering now - standard gimmicks , from regional editions to discounts for frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>. 
692 But now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>is attempting to fight back , with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign . 
845 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Advertisers </ENAMEX>do n't think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>first , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan McCraw </ENAMEX>, who joined in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April </TIMEX>as national advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>. 
964 ` What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance . 
1018 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace , and in many ways we were n't . ' 
1110 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">101 - year - old </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>has never had to woo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>with quite so much fervor before . 
1203 It largely rested on its hard - to - fault demographics : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 . 8 million </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half </TIMEX>, up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 . 5 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago </TIMEX>; an average age of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">42 </TIMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers </ENAMEX>- - at the height of their consuming years ; loyalty to the tune of an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 % </NUMEX>average subscription renewal rate . 
1476 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>had its best year yet in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>, when it celebrated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its centennial </TIMEX>and racked up a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 % </NUMEX>gain in ad pages , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">283 </NUMEX>. 
1600 But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, when the hullabaloo surrounding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its centennial </TIMEX>died , so too did some advertiser interest . 
1705 The reason , ad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>say , is that the entire magazine business has been soft - - and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic </ENAMEX>has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market . 
1891 Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices - - <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 130 , 000 </NUMEX>for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>- color page , vs . <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 47 , 000 </NUMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smithsonian </ENAMEX>, a comparable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publication </ENAMEX>with a far smaller circulation . 
2075 When ad dollars are tight , the high page cost is a major deterrent for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>, who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all . 
2232 Even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic </ENAMEX>offers far more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers </ENAMEX>than does a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smithsonian </ENAMEX>, ` the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Glass </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bozell Inc .  
2449 To combat that problem , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic </ENAMEX>, like other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines </ENAMEX>, began offering regional editions allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>to appear in only a portion of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines </ENAMEX>- - for example , ads can run only in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines </ENAMEX>sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers </ENAMEX>in the largest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 </NUMEX>markets . 
2714 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>was slower than its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>to come up with its regional editions , and until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>offered fewer of them than did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>. 
2866 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>, for example , has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100 </NUMEX>separate editions going to different regions , top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management </ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups </ENAMEX>. 
2994 Another sticking point for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic </ENAMEX>' s tradition of lumping its ads together , usually at the beginning or end of the magazine , rather than spreading ads out among its articles , as most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines </ENAMEX>do . 
3219 And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic </ENAMEX>' s smaller - than - average size means extra production costs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>. 
3319 But Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCraw </ENAMEX>says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>is fighting back . 
3370 It now offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 </NUMEX>regional editions , it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles , and it has been beefing up its sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force </ENAMEX>. 
3507 And it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>, marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors </ENAMEX>, and media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>just that . 
3632 The centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign , into which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>will pour <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 500 , 000 </NUMEX>, mostly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few weeks </TIMEX>. 
3769 The campaign , created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Omnicom Group </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DDB Needham </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency </ENAMEX>, takes advantage of the eye - catching photography that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic </ENAMEX>is known for . 
3917 In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>ad , a photo of the interior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Sainte - Chapelle </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris </ENAMEX>is paired with the headline , ` The only book more respected than ours does n't accept advertising . ' 
4082 Another ad pictures a tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ant </ENAMEX>, magnified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 </NUMEX>times , with the headline , ` For impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions . ' 
4221 Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCraw </ENAMEX>says she wants the campaign to help attract <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 </NUMEX>categories , including corporate , financial services , consumer electronics , insurance and food . 
4389 Her goal : to top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300 </NUMEX>ad pages in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>, up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 274 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
4457 Whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain . 
4525 ` The ad campaign is meant to contemporize the thought of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic </ENAMEX>, ' she says . 
4614 ` We want it to be a ' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">90s </TIMEX>kind of image . '

4683 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS Group </ENAMEX>hopes to announce , perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>, an agreement to sell the majority of its ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX>ad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>said . 
4833 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS </ENAMEX>has been in discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom </ENAMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several months </TIMEX>. 
4895 However , when negotiations bogged down recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS </ENAMEX>' s chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Scott </ENAMEX>, met in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris </ENAMEX>with another <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit </ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BDDP </ENAMEX>. 
5055 According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BDDP </ENAMEX>' s involvement prompted renewed vigor in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom </ENAMEX>talks and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies </ENAMEX>were hoping to hammer out details by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>.

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT Corp . </ENAMEX>said its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors </ENAMEX>declared a dividend of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five cents </NUMEX>per Class A common stock payable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov . 6 </TIMEX>to stock of record <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 16 </TIMEX>. 
170 The dividend represents the balance of its regular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly </TIMEX>payout of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cents </NUMEX>a share , of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>was paid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 17 </TIMEX>in a final distribution prior to its merger with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B . B . Real Estate Investment Corp . </ENAMEX>, also in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>. 
388 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it hopes to resume its schedule of regular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly </TIMEX>dividends at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of this year </TIMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TRW Inc . </ENAMEX>reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 % </NUMEX>decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>net income , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said that excluding unusual gains in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">both quarters </TIMEX>, operating profit rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 % </NUMEX>. 
167 The electronics , automotive and aerospace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>net was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">98 cents </NUMEX>a share , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 68 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 11 </NUMEX>a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
335 Share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>tradition . 
413 Results for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 quarter </TIMEX>included a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 05 </NUMEX>a share from sale of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reda Pump </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oilwell Cable </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units </ENAMEX>, partly offset by a charge of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">69 cents </NUMEX>a share for recall of faulty truck steering systems . 
618 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">The latest quarter </TIMEX>included a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11 cents </NUMEX>a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge , because the reserve established <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>exceeded the actual recall costs . 
795 Sales for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 . 3 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 79 billion </NUMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 65 billion </NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three </NUMEX>major product groups reporting gains . 
920 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said aerospace and defense sales were up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 % </NUMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 802 million </NUMEX>, and operating profit climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 61 million </NUMEX>, mainly because of improved program performance in spacecraft and advanced - technology contracts . 
1155 Automotive sales jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 791 million </NUMEX>, mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TRW </ENAMEX>said . 
1292 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>had an operating profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 65 million </NUMEX>, against a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
1388 However , excluding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year - earlier </TIMEX>charge for recall of steering gear , operating profit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter </TIMEX>declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 % </NUMEX>, reflecting higher start - up and product development expenses in passenger - restraint systems . 
1605 Materials and production costs also rose , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TRW </ENAMEX>said . 
1659 The information systems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">segment </ENAMEX>had a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 % </NUMEX>jump sales to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 196 million </NUMEX>. 
1729 An acquisition accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>the sales rise , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TRW </ENAMEX>said . 
1789 Operating profit rose threefold to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18 million </NUMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 million </NUMEX>. 
1856 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TRW </ENAMEX>' s net was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 199 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 22 </NUMEX>a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 205 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 33 </NUMEX>a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
1984 Sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 . 9 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 42 billion </NUMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 27 billion </NUMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helionetics Inc . </ENAMEX>said it agreed to team with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honeywell Inc . </ENAMEX>to provide power amplifiers for a new military sonar system being proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honeywell </ENAMEX>. 
188 Total value of the contract could be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million </NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helionetics </ENAMEX>said , and work on the project would be about evenly divided . 
314 As previously reported , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helionetics </ENAMEX>emerged from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11 </ENAMEX>bankruptcy - law protection in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February </TIMEX>.  

9 THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">R . H . MACY &amp; CO . </ENAMEX>department - store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain </ENAMEX>is n't for sale . 
68 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s edition , it was incorrectly included with a list of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains </ENAMEX>up for sale .  

9 After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years </TIMEX>of drought , it rained money in the stock - index futures markets yesterday . 
101 As financial markets rebounded , trading volume in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange </ENAMEX>' s huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor ' s </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 </NUMEX>stock - index futures pit soared , reaching near - record levels for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>time since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>. 
313 The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>to reap six - figure windfalls in a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes </TIMEX>as prices soared , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>said . 
454 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guys </ENAMEX>were minting money in there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Legittino </ENAMEX>, a futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elders Futures Inc . </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>. 
572 The S &amp; P 500 futures contract , which moves in fractions of an index point under normal conditions , jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to three </NUMEX>points in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early yesterday </TIMEX>after an initial downturn , then moved strongly higher the rest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>. 
799 Each index point represents a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 </NUMEX>profit for each S &amp; P 500 contract held . 
873 For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>time since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>said that they were able to trade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred </NUMEX>S &amp; P 500 contracts at a time in a highly liquid market . 
1029 Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>have shied away from stock - index futures , blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>. 
1194 Since the crash , many futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>have n't assumed large positions for fear that the S &amp; P 500 market , with much of its customer order flow missing , would dry up if prices turned against them . 
1390 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 400 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>jammed the S &amp; P 500 futures pit to await the opening bell . 
1470 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>were shouting bids and offers <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a full five minutes </TIMEX>before the start of trading at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 : 30 am  
1569 The contract fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>points at the open to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">323 . 85 </NUMEX>, the maximum opening move allowed under safeguards adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc </ENAMEX>to stem a market slide . 
1716 But several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>quickly stepped up and bid for contracts , driving prices sharply higher . 
1809 The market hovered near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s closing price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">328 . 85 </NUMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about a half hour </TIMEX>, moving several index points higher or lower in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds </TIMEX>, then broke higher and did n't look back . 
1987 The S &amp; P 500 contract that expires in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December </TIMEX>closed up a record <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 . 65 </NUMEX>points on volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 80 , 000 </NUMEX>contracts . 
2105 ` Traders <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">five feet </NUMEX>from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart , ' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>S &amp; P 500 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker </ENAMEX>. 
2224 ` You could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune , ' he marveled . 
2308 Several of Wall Street ' s largest securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc . </ENAMEX>, were also large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>said . 
2451 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers </ENAMEX>was among the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers </ENAMEX>of stock - index futures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>said . 
2546 Brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>as a rule do n't comment on their market activity . 
2614 Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week </TIMEX>following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>, individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>in the S &amp; P 500 pit were also being uncharacteristically circumspect about their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one - day </TIMEX>profits . 
2786 ` With the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI </ENAMEX>around here , bragging rights are a thing of the past , ' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>, referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far has resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 </NUMEX>indictments lodged against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals </ENAMEX>on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MEDUSA Corp . </ENAMEX>said it voluntarily prepaid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 million </NUMEX>on its original <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 million </NUMEX>term loan , bringing the total debt reduction for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year </TIMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18 million </NUMEX>. 
163 After the payment , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>owes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57 million </NUMEX>on the loan . 
234 The cement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer </ENAMEX>said the payment was made from excess cash flow .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Golden West Financial Corp . </ENAMEX>, riding above the turbulence that has troubled most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>industry , posted a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 % </NUMEX>increase of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>earnings to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 41 . 8 millon </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">66 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
199 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">57 cents </NUMEX>a share , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year - ago quarter </TIMEX>. 
279 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert M . Sandler </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Oakland </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, savings - and - loan holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, credited the high number of loans added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s portfolio over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the last 12 months </TIMEX>for broadening its earning asset base and improving profit performance . 
559 However , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>noted that slackening demand for new mortgages depressed new loan originations to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion </NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % </NUMEX>below the same period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>. 
715 In savings activity , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandler </ENAMEX>said consumer deposits have enjoyed a steady increase throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>, and topped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 billion </NUMEX>at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">quarter ' s end </TIMEX>for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>time in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s history . 
904 Deposit growth amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 393 million </NUMEX>, more than double the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - ago </TIMEX>figure .  

9 The sudden ` flight to quality ' that triggered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s explosive bond - market rally was reversed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>in a ` flight from quality ' rout . 
150 The setback , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bond prices plummeted , reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit - taking . 
265 ` It was a pretty wild day . 
292 Our markets were closely tied to the stock market , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Kazis </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>of trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney , Harris Upham &amp; Co </ENAMEX>. 
416 ` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs , ' he said . 
515 Some fixed - income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>had expected a further drop in stock prices after the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 200 </NUMEX>- point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
666 That caused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>to flee stocks and buy high - quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bonds , which are safer than other types of securities . 
788 But when stocks began to climb instead , prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bonds declined . 
865 Contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>advising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios . 
1047 Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .  
1120 The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve </ENAMEX>eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 1 \/ 2 % </NUMEX>. 
1282 The closely watched rate on federal funds , or overnight loans between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>, slid to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 3 \/ 4 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>, down from its perceived target level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9 % </NUMEX>. 
1441 The rate is considered an early signal of changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>policy . 
1506 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s modest easing did n't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected . 
1610 In fact , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists </ENAMEX>contend that the latest easing started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>. 
1685 Others note that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing . 
1789 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>' s benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 - year </TIMEX>bond , ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1 3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>points lower , or down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 17 . 50 </NUMEX>for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 , 000 </NUMEX>face amount . 
1910 The reversal was even more evident among shorter - term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>securities . 
1985 After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bill rates plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 0 . 70 </NUMEX>percentage point on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, they gave back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three - fourths </NUMEX>of that amount <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
2120 The bond - equivalent yield on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three - month </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bills , for example , was quoted late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 72 % </NUMEX>, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 16 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
2256 Investment - grade corporate bonds , mortgage - backed securities and municipal bonds also fell . 
2350 But prices of junk bonds , which were battered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>in near standstill trading , rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session . 
2495 Junk bonds opened <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as four </NUMEX>points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed . 
2595 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>said the high - yield market was helped by active institutional buying . 
2678 In particular , they said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . </ENAMEX>began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels . 
2872 ` I think the willingness of securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>to make markets for high - yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lonski </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody ' s Investors Service Inc .  
3066 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . S . Treasury </ENAMEX>bonds were higher in overnight trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>, which opened at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 7 : 30 p . m . EDT </TIMEX>. 
3166 The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 - year </TIMEX>bond , for example rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>point in early <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>trading in reaction to a quick <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600 </NUMEX>- point drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>stock market . 
3312 But as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>stocks rebounded , Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher . 
3400 Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations </ENAMEX>, wanting to keep a watchful eye on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>trading as an indication of where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>trading would begin , were fully staffed during the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>trading session . 
3588 ` Most of the action was during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night </TIMEX>session , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Moore </ENAMEX>, trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Bank </ENAMEX>. 
3698 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Goldinger </ENAMEX>, who often trades overnight for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capital Insight Inc . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, said trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>was ` very active ' but highly volatile . 
3850 ` We went down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>point in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes </TIMEX>right before lunch , then after lunch we went up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>point in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 minutes </TIMEX>, ' he said . 
3971 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>, trading is halted during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunchtime </TIMEX>. 
4019 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>' s market turned out to be a bad bellwether for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>trading . 
4086 When the market opened here , bonds prices fell as the stock market regained strength . 
4174 The bond market ' s focus on stock activity was so strong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>that it overshadowed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>' s slate of economic data , which includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>' s report on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>merchandise trade and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>industrial production . 
4404 Industrial production is expected to have declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 2 % </NUMEX>, according to a consensus of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists </ENAMEX>surveyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones Capital Markets Report </ENAMEX>. 
4546 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>trade deficit is expected to have widened to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 . 1 billion </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 . 58 billion </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>. 
4643 A widening of that magnitude , said one <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>, is ` not a favorable number . . . . 
4733 It could do damage to us . ' 
4762 Meanwhile , agency supply is expected to weigh heavily on the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Home Loan Bank </ENAMEX>prices a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 3 billion </NUMEX>offering of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one - year </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three - year </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five - year </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 - year </TIMEX>maturities . 
4960 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tomorrow </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resolution Funding Corp . </ENAMEX>will provide details of its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>bond issue , which is expected to total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 4 billion and $ 6 billion </NUMEX>and carry a maturity greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 years </TIMEX>. 
5150 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Resolution Funding </ENAMEX>is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">division </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Resolution Trust Corp . </ENAMEX>, the new federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency </ENAMEX>created to bail out the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts </ENAMEX>. 
5286 And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tennessee Valley Authority </ENAMEX>plans to price a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion </NUMEX>offering , its first public debt borrowing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">15 years </TIMEX>. 
5416 ` There ' s lots of supply , ' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>said . 
5468 ` We have a couple or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three tough weeks </TIMEX>coming . ' 
5518 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>Securities 
5540 Prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bonds tumbled in moderate to active trading . 
5606 The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 - year </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bond was quoted late at a price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 19 \/ 32 </NUMEX>, compared with a closing price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103 12 \/ 32 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
5734 The yield on the benchmark issue rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 97 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 82 % </NUMEX>. 
5795 The latest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 - year </TIMEX>notes were quoted late at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 3 \/ 32 </NUMEX>for a yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 97 % </NUMEX>, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 9 \/ 32 </NUMEX>to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 84 % </NUMEX>. 
5912 Short - term interest rates fell <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bill auction . 
6003 The average discount rate on new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three - month </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bills was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 37 % </NUMEX>, the lowest since the average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 36 % </NUMEX>at the auction on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 17 , 1988 </TIMEX>. 
6145 The average discount rate was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 42 % </NUMEX>on new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six - month </TIMEX>bills , the lowest since the average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 35 % </NUMEX>at the auction on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 31 , 1989 </TIMEX>. 
6278 Here are auction details : 
6306 Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value . 
6388 Thus , higher bidding narrows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX>' s return while lower bidding widens it . 
6470 The percentage rates are calculated on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a 360 - day year </TIMEX>, while the coupon - equivalent yield is based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a 365 - day year </TIMEX>. 
6589 Both issues are dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 19 </TIMEX>. 
6620 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">13 - week </TIMEX>bills mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan . 18 , 1990 </TIMEX>, and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">26 - week </TIMEX>bills mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 19 , 1990 </TIMEX>. 
6705 Corporate Issues 
6724 Investment - grade corporate bonds ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>point lower . 
6789 There were no new issues . 
6817 Foreign Bonds 
6833 Foreign bonds surged as the dollar weakened against most major currencies . 
6910 Among benchmark issues : - - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>' s No . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111 </NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 . 6 % </NUMEX>bond due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1998 </TIMEX>ended on brokers screens at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96 . 15 </NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 . 17 </NUMEX>point . 
7024 The yield was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 . 245 % </NUMEX>. 
7048 - - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 3 \/ 4 % </NUMEX>issue due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1999 </TIMEX>ended at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 . 30 </NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 . 91 </NUMEX>point to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 . 99 % </NUMEX>.

7305 Mortgage - Backed Securities 
7334 Mortgage securities gave up most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s gains as active issues ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 \/ 32 to 30 \/ 32 </NUMEX>point lower . 
7438 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers </ENAMEX>said morning activity was hectic as prices dropped in response to gains in the stock market and losses in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>securities , but trading slowed to moderate levels in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>. 
7631 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Government National Mortgage Association </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 % </NUMEX>securities for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November </TIMEX>delivery were quoted late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 4 \/ 32 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 \/ 32 </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 1 \/ 2 % </NUMEX>securities were down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 \/ 32 </NUMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 5 \/ 32 </NUMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>securities were at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 2 \/ 32 </NUMEX>, off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 \/ 32 </NUMEX>. 
7866 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp . </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 % </NUMEX>securities were at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>. 
7939 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, mortgage issues gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 1 5 \/ 32 </NUMEX>. 
7994 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Late yesterday </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ginnie Mae </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 % </NUMEX>securities were yielding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 . 39 % </NUMEX>to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12 - year </TIMEX>average life assumption , as the spread above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 - year </TIMEX>note narrowed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 . 01 </NUMEX>percentage point to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 . 42 </NUMEX>. 
8180 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>said there were some busy dealings in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freddie Mac </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal National Mortgage Association </ENAMEX>securities because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriters </ENAMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>' s heavy slate of real estate mortgage investment conduit issues moved to gather collateral for new deals . 
8435 Offsetting the Remic - related purchases were continued heavy sales by mortgage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">originators </ENAMEX>, which are producing increased amounts of fixed - rate mortgage - backed issues with lower rates . 
8621 There was no new - issue activity in the derivative market . 
8681 Municipals 
8694 Rebounding stocks and weaker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>prices drove municipal bonds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 \/ 4 to 3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>point lower in late dealings . 
8804 The session losses left municipal dollar bonds close to where they were before the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 . 58 </NUMEX>- point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>prompted a capital markets rally . 
8984 Trading was hectic during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning </TIMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players </ENAMEX>trying to gauge whether equities would continue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness . 
9148 Tax - exempts started the session flat to a touch higher on anticipation of further stock market erosion , but bond prices rapidly turned south as it became more clear that a repeat of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>crash was n't at hand . 
9371 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professionals </ENAMEX>dominated municipal trading throughout the session . 
9437 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>said retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>seemed to be hugging the sidelines until a measure of volatility is wrung out of the market . 
9562 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">New Jersey Turnpike Authority </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 20 % </NUMEX>issue of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2018 </TIMEX>was off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>bid , yielding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 32 % </NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 07 percentage point </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday </TIMEX>. 
9702 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Florida Board of Education </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 1 \/ 4 % </NUMEX>issue of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2023 </TIMEX>was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 \/ 8 </NUMEX>point weaker at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>bid . 
9788 The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 1 \/ 8 % </NUMEX>issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>, due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2019 </TIMEX>, was off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 \/ 8 </NUMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 1 \/ 8 </NUMEX>bid . 
9897 And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Fairfax County </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Water Authority </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 1 \/ 4 % </NUMEX>issue of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2027 </TIMEX>was down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 7 \/ 8 </NUMEX>bid . 
9991 Serial bond yields were up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 0 . 05 percentage point </NUMEX>.  

9 The latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T . Boone Pickens </ENAMEX>tells about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy </ENAMEX>who was run over by the parade . 
144 When asked ` What went wrong ? ' the unfortunate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim </ENAMEX>replied , ` It was a combination of things . ' 
240 And so it was on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Gray Friday </ENAMEX>. 
272 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grand marshal </ENAMEX>of this parade would appear to have been excess leverage . 
348 Even if that is so , however , it ' s probably the case that no barriers should have been erected to stop the procession before the end of the rout -LRB- e -RRB- . 
498 The ceremonies began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>when word spread that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>buy - out was collapsing . 
590 Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">union - bidder </ENAMEX>expects to patch together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure to get cash from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>confirmed a growing fear among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers </ENAMEX>that the pageant of high - leverage takeover deals is ending . 
849 Lots of other entries made up the parade , of course - - notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , signalling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve </ENAMEX>tightness ; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>' s -LRB- temporary ? -RRB- defeat in trying to lower the capital - gains tax . 
1092 As usual , few favorable reviews were heard for that ever - present marching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">band </ENAMEX>of program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>, although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write . 
1275 What really spooked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds </ENAMEX>along Wall Street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt capital is drying up . 
1423 <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Gray Friday </ENAMEX>reflects a panic mainly by the takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers </ENAMEX>, rather than the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX>, as their highly margined investments in the ` deal ' stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing . 
1661 Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses . 
1731 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>, which triggered the slide , opened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 224 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday </TIMEX>' s close . 
1824 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>opened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 20 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday </TIMEX>' s close . 
1889 -LRB- Both took further hits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. -RRB- 
1925 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton </ENAMEX>lost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 % </NUMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paramount </ENAMEX>lost almost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 % </NUMEX>. 
1979 A careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">target </ENAMEX>' s stock price was not affected on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
2099 The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multibillion - dollar </NUMEX>prospects , where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidder </ENAMEX>must line up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consortium </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>and \/ or issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions </NUMEX>in high - yield debt , were where the damage was concentrated . 
2270 The market for so - called junk bonds has been setting the stage for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s dramatic march for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several weeks </TIMEX>. 
2380 The growing financial difficulties of recent high - leverage restructurings or takeovers , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resorts International </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated Resources </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau </ENAMEX>' s retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire </ENAMEX>, have cast a pall over the entire market for high - yield securities . 
2620 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors </ENAMEX>have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ohio Mattress </ENAMEX>and by forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada </ENAMEX>to postpone indefinitely its planned junk - bond sale and restructuring . 
2800 As a result , high - yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>planning to sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 billion </NUMEX>in junk bonds before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - end </TIMEX>are experiencing anxious times . 
2980 These are all market excesses -LRB- putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity -RRB- , and what we ' ve seen is the market reining them in . 
3144 Of course , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>had n't been silent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the days </TIMEX>leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
3425 If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Gray Friday </ENAMEX>, what are the implications for policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers </ENAMEX>? 
3558 After all , the stock market ' s response to the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>deal might be taken to confirm the anti - debt direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>. 
3694 Is this a case where private markets are approving of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>' s bashing of Wall Street ? 
3785 Absolutely not . 
3803 To the extent that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s sell - off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior . 
4050 The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>be the ultimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges </ENAMEX>of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings . 
4261 The recent difficulties in the junk - bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate . 
4422 If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealmakers </ENAMEX>become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers </ENAMEX>, and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions . 
4689 Yes , the broader <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>got caught up in the spiral , but they rode the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger </ENAMEX>up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">all year </TIMEX>.

4822 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers </ENAMEX>and takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">initiatiors </ENAMEX>got killed on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Gray Friday </ENAMEX>, while the besieged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>of prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">targets </ENAMEX>cheered lustily . 
4958 If you identify with the besieged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>, you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>. 
5159 If you side with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raiders </ENAMEX>, you clearly have more to fear from private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>than from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Delaware </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts </ENAMEX>should never be underestimated .

5628 Any such attempt to distinguish ` good debt ' from ` bad debt , ' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines </ENAMEX>, is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general . 
5890 Far better for policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers </ENAMEX>to concentrate on the war against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama </ENAMEX>and the deficit , all of them parades that seem never to end .

204 ` It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Hammond </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator </ENAMEX>, who called the agreement to meet a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>step toward a resumption of negotiations . 
377 ` We ' re encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that , we have made no expression of expectations , ' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said . 
515 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union </ENAMEX>has rejected a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three - year </TIMEX>contract offer that would have provided a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>wage increase over the life of the pact , plus some bonuses .

702 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it can redeem the warrants at its option for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 </NUMEX>each . 
773 The offer is n't contingent on a certain amount of debt or stock being exchanged . 
856 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BSN </ENAMEX>said it is making the offer to shrink its capital and increase shareholder value . 
942 If all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders </ENAMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million </NUMEX>common shares accept the offer , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BSN </ENAMEX>will increase its debt by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 million </NUMEX>, but it also will recognize a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 million </NUMEX>gain from retiring the old debt , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael J .

1178 ` We have sufficient cash flow to handle that , ' he said . 
1236 The offers are scheduled to expire in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid to late November </TIMEX>.

429 The offer , which also includes common and preferred stock purchase rights , was to expire <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night </TIMEX>at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight </TIMEX>. 
542 The new expiration date is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the date </TIMEX>on which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DIG </ENAMEX>' s financing commitments , which total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 240 million </NUMEX>, are to expire . 
663 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DIG </ENAMEX>is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DIG Holding Corp . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rose Partners L .

728 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg </ENAMEX>is the sole general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rose Partners </ENAMEX>. 
789 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Di Giorgio </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX>food products and building materials marketing and distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, rejected Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg </ENAMEX>' s offer as inadequate .

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Whirlpool Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Benton Harbor </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich . </ENAMEX>, said it has developed a process to recover environmentally harmful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chlorofluorocarbons </ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs </ENAMEX>, that previously entered the atmosphere during in - home repair of refrigerators and freezers . 
239 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of home appliances said the process , which involves the use of a multilayer plastic bag during repairs to capture the gaseous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">substance </ENAMEX>and transport it to a recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center </ENAMEX>, is already in use at a number of its service <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers </ENAMEX>, and will be available to all authorized repair <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers </ENAMEX>by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">spring </TIMEX>. 
545 Earlier repairs vented the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs </ENAMEX>out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home </ENAMEX>through a hose directly into the atmosphere . 
640 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs </ENAMEX>are widely used as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">solvents </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">coolants </ENAMEX>and fire <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">suppressants </ENAMEX>. 
706 But their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Earth </ENAMEX>' s ozone layer , and a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>are seeking to curtail use , or at least emission , of the substance . 
895 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Whirpool </ENAMEX>said , ` We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFC </ENAMEX>use in appliance manufacture .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waterford Wedgwood PLC </ENAMEX>, a financially troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crystal </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wedgwood </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">china </ENAMEX>, reported that its pretax loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first six months </TIMEX>widened to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 . 6 million Irish punts </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14 . 9 million </NUMEX>-RRB- from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 . 8 million Irish punts </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
258 The results for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>were worse than market expectations , which suggested an interim loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 10 million Irish punts </NUMEX>. 
386 In a sharply weaker <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waterford </ENAMEX>shares were down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 pence </NUMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 pence </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">79 cents </NUMEX>-RRB- . 
493 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14 million Irish punts </NUMEX>, compared with a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9 . 3 million Irish punts </NUMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year - earlier period </TIMEX>. 
663 There were n't any extraordinary items . 
704 Sales for the total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">168 . 1 million Irish punts </NUMEX>compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">132 . 6 million Irish punts </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago </TIMEX>. 
820 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waterford </ENAMEX>has decided against paying an interim dividend . 
880 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waterford </ENAMEX>said the appointment of a new management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team </ENAMEX>and the signing of a comprehensive labor agreement are expected to enhance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s long - term prospects .  

9 In an attempt to give new momentum to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community </ENAMEX>plans for a single currency , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC </ENAMEX>government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on amending the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC </ENAMEX>' s founding <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty of Rome </ENAMEX>. 
225 According to diplomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Brussels </ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>agree that talks should begin in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second half of 1990 </TIMEX>, and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Strasbourg </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec . 8 </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">9 </TIMEX>. 
446 The only strong opposition to changing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC </ENAMEX>treaty comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher </ENAMEX>, who is opposed to creating a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC </ENAMEX>currency . 
601 But the process of convening the intergovernmental conference does n't require unanimity . 
692 Setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push . 
829 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois Mitterrand </ENAMEX>fought to set a date for the conference during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC </ENAMEX>summit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Madrid </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last June </TIMEX>, but the move was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl </ENAMEX>. 
1055 Diplomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources </ENAMEX>said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kohl </ENAMEX>may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany </ENAMEX>is still committed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC </ENAMEX>unity .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>retail sales volume rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a provisional 0 . 4 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>and was up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 . 2 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1988 </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Trade and Industry </ENAMEX>said . 
168 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the three months ended in September </TIMEX>, retail sales volume was down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 5 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous three months </TIMEX>and up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 2 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>.  

9 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Aviation Subcommittee </ENAMEX>approved a bill that would give the transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>authority to review and approve leveraged buy - outs of major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines </ENAMEX>. 
179 The collapsed plan to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines </ENAMEX>, spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday </TIMEX>and approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee </ENAMEX>on a voice vote <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
369 The bill is expected to be taken up by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Public Works and Transportation Committee </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow </TIMEX>, and a floor vote by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week </TIMEX>will be urged . 
511 The measure drew criticism from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>and a parting shot from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump </ENAMEX>, who <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>withdrew his takeover bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp . </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines </ENAMEX>. 
703 In a letter to subcommittee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Oberstar </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minn . </ENAMEX>-RRB- , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>, and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal . 
902 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine Chao </ENAMEX>, deputy transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>, also sent a letter to express the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>' s opposition to the bill ` in its present form . ' 
1047 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oberstar </ENAMEX>brushed off Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>' s allegations as an ` excuse for his own deal failing . ' 
1138 He also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Skinner </ENAMEX>indicated there is ` wiggle room ' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>' s position . 
1308 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oberstar </ENAMEX>and other committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation . 
1444 But they cited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation . 
1540 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Aides </ENAMEX>both in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>said the withdrawal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation . 
1677 ` It ' s still on the fast track and we still want to do it , ' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide </ENAMEX>. 
1760 The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline </ENAMEX>might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy - out . 
1914 Currently , the transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit . 
2128 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Supporters </ENAMEX>of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline - acquisition process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry . 
2310 In general , the bill would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department </ENAMEX>a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 - day </TIMEX>review period before <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % </NUMEX>or more of the voting stock of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier </ENAMEX>could be acquired . 
2481 It also would require the acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">party </ENAMEX>to notify the transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition . 
2650 The bill would allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>to reject a buy - out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy - out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline </ENAMEX>through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest . 
2940 If more information is needed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>would have authority to extend the review period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 days </TIMEX>. 
3045 All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses </ENAMEX>, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen </ENAMEX>and industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts </ENAMEX>, expressed support for the bill in order to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">profiteers </ENAMEX>from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost - effective service . 
3248 But several committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>disapproved , some backing Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>' s claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>deal and the stock - market plunge . 
3418 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines </ENAMEX>would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">entities </ENAMEX>and producing independent spin - off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>.  

9 THE STOCK MARKET AVOIDED a repeat of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>as prices recovered from an early slide , spurred by bargain - hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>and program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders </ENAMEX>.

310 The rally erased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half </NUMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 . 58 </NUMEX>- point plunge , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>are cautious about the market ' s outlook .

990 Leveraged buy - outs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines </ENAMEX>would be subject to approval by the transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>under a bill passed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee </ENAMEX>.

189 <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A minute </TIMEX>later it soared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">128 </NUMEX>points , then zoomed back down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113 </NUMEX>points , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69 </NUMEX>below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s close . 
287 ` It was crazy , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Weisman </ENAMEX>, general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chilmark Capital Corp .  
364 ` It was like flying without a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot </ENAMEX>in the front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">plane </ENAMEX>. ' 
430 But those who said ` This ca n't be happening ' were right . 
487 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotrons </ENAMEX>were wrong . 
514 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron Systems Inc . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>, blamed the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 - minute </TIMEX>foul - up on ` a timing problem in our software ' caused by the enormous early volume - - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 145 million </NUMEX>shares in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour </TIMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>trading . 
738 The prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron </ENAMEX>said , but the average was wrong . 
856 Meanwhile , there was an awful lot of confusion . 
904 At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 10 : 40 a . m . </TIMEX>on the over - the - counter trading desk at a major brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, a veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>who buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>and asked , ` What ' s going on ? 
1112 Is the market up or down ? ' 
1141 At the time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron </ENAMEX>was reporting that the industrial average was down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 </NUMEX>points . 
1224 In fact , it was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 </NUMEX>. 
1249 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holly Stark </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>who heads the trading desk at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dillon Read Capital Corp . </ENAMEX>, said that once she figured out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron </ENAMEX>numbers were wrong , she called <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers </ENAMEX>to tell them . 
1432 ` It ' s been kind of annoying , to say the least , ' she said . 
1490 To confuse matters further , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp . </ENAMEX>stock finally opened on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 : 08 a . m . </TIMEX>, the price was listed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 324 . 75 </NUMEX>a share , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 45 </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>; in fact , its true price was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 224 . 75 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55 </NUMEX>. 
1716 That was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>' s blooper . 
1764 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>cited a ` technical error ' and declined to elaborate . 
1831 And there were other blunders . 
1862 When the market opened at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 : 30 a . m . EST </TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reuters </ENAMEX>newswire miscalculated the industrial average ' s drop as a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 % </NUMEX>decline when it really was down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 7 % </NUMEX>. 
2029 ` It was a case of human error , which we found almost immediately and corrected , ' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reuter </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>said . 
2153 Meanwhile , some currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt </ENAMEX>said they sold dollars on the news and had to buy them back later at higher prices . 
2306 But it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron </ENAMEX>problems that had lingering effects . 
2366 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dillon Read </ENAMEX>' s Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stark </ENAMEX>said in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early afternoon </TIMEX>that she was still viewing prices and other data as subject to verification , and she said portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>continued to question the numbers they saw on the screen . 
2583 It was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">less than a week </TIMEX>that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron </ENAMEX>has had problems calculating the industrial average . 
2692 At the start of trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Wednesday </TIMEX>, the average appeared to plunge <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200 </NUMEX>points . 
2785 Actually , it was down only a few points at the time . 
2840 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron </ENAMEX>said that snafu , which lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine minutes </TIMEX>, resulted from a failure to adjust for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 </NUMEX>- for - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 </NUMEX>stock split at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris Cos .  
2976 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman </ENAMEX>said recent software changes may have contributed to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s problems . 
3073 She said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron </ENAMEX>switched to a backup system until the problems were corrected . 
3155 ` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today </TIMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">all days </TIMEX>, ' she lamented . 
3190 ` The eyes of the world were watching us .

154 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southmark Corp . </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator </ENAMEX>of nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">homes </ENAMEX>and retirement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">centers </ENAMEX>said it sustained a net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 6 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nine cents </NUMEX>a share , compared with net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 3 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eight cents </NUMEX>a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
394 Operating revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 22 . 2 million </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 . 7 million </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year - earlier quarter </TIMEX>. 
488 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 1 million </NUMEX>reserve was created to reflect doubt about the collectability of receivables owed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Heritage </ENAMEX>by some of the real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnerships </ENAMEX>it manages . 
677 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>also said expenses incurred by the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management </ENAMEX>in the recent contest for control were recognized primarily in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter ended Sept . 30 </TIMEX>.

422 A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>- judge appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>refused to comply , though liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Wald </ENAMEX>went out of her way to deny that this was a ` frivolous ' case . 
571 Of course it was . 
589 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NASA </ENAMEX>should now sue for fines against all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>politico - <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs </ENAMEX>, foreign and domestic , for bringing this mischievous case .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanislav Ovcharenko </ENAMEX>, who represents the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>here , has some visions that are wild even by the current standards of perestroika . 
159 In his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>overlooking the runway of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon Airport </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ovcharenko </ENAMEX>enthusiastically throws out what he calls ` just ideas ' : 
289 <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First </NUMEX>, he suggests , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GPA Group Ltd . </ENAMEX>, the international aircraft leasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ireland </ENAMEX>, could lease some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">jetliners </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline </ENAMEX>. 
450 Then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Lingus </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish </ENAMEX>flag <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier </ENAMEX>, could teach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots </ENAMEX>to fly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeings </ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fleet </ENAMEX>could be based here at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon Airport </ENAMEX>. 
595 That ' s not all , he says . 
620 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Rianta </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish </ENAMEX>airport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">authority </ENAMEX>, could build a cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">terminal </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union </ENAMEX>. 
711 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>could lease some of its cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Lingus </ENAMEX>, through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GPA </ENAMEX>, for a joint - venture cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline </ENAMEX>. 
820 And then there is his notion of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX>charter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline </ENAMEX>to ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Armenians </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX>via <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon </ENAMEX>. 
933 Have the freedoms of glasnost gone to Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ovcharenko </ENAMEX>' s head ? 
996 Hardly . 
1004 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX>aviation connection is alive and well here at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon Airport </ENAMEX>. 
1084 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GPA </ENAMEX>is indeed talking about leasing Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>and even about buying <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX>- built <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tupolev </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">204s </ENAMEX>. 
1196 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Lingus </ENAMEX>is in discussions with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier </ENAMEX>about a cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>and other possibilities . 
1296 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Rianta </ENAMEX>already has so many ventures with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>that its chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>is studying <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian </ENAMEX>. 
1398 Unlikely as it may seem , tiny , politically neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ireland </ENAMEX>has penetrated the mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX>airline bureaucracy . 
1511 And as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>struggles to boost its service standards , upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish </ENAMEX>aviation industry seems poised to benefit . 
1679 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>are similar , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ovcharenko </ENAMEX>. 
1739 ` They look the same . 
1760 They ' re very friendly . ' 
1784 Moreover , he says , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>are small but spunky . 
1841 ` We have to study their experience very well , ' he says . 
1897 ` We must find any way to get business . ' 
1937 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>groups have been working together since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the late 1970s </TIMEX>, long before <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX>joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures </ENAMEX>were the rage in the West . 
2062 Aeroflot carried <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 125 million </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon Airport </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline </ENAMEX>' s largest transit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport </ENAMEX>outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union </ENAMEX>, saw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 400 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>flights and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers </ENAMEX>pass through . 
2268 An apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complex </ENAMEX>down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road </ENAMEX>is the crew - rest and staging area for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 130 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots </ENAMEX>and flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants </ENAMEX>. 
2396 The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport </ENAMEX>' s biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supplier </ENAMEX>of aircraft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel </ENAMEX>is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union </ENAMEX>. 
2465 <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">Tankers </ENAMEX>from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Latvian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">port </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ventspils </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year </TIMEX>unload <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">25 million gallons </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel </ENAMEX>into a special tank farm at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport </ENAMEX>. 
2593 What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>does n't pour into its own gas - guzzling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">Ilyushins </ENAMEX>is bartered to the airport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">authority </ENAMEX>, which resells it to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 </NUMEX>Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers </ENAMEX>including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Air France </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trans World Airlines </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pakistan International Airlines </ENAMEX>. 
2814 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>thus pays its landing fees , ground - handling and catering bills with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel </ENAMEX>, preserving its hard currency . 
2929 That is n't all . 
2945 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish </ENAMEX>airport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">authority </ENAMEX>, in a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>, opened <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>hard - currency duty - free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Sheremetyevo Airport </ENAMEX>. 
3095 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Rianta </ENAMEX>now manages duty - free sales on all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>international flights out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow </ENAMEX>. 
3187 Duty - free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Leningrad </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Pulkova Airport </ENAMEX>opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>, and hard - currency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Leningrad </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotels </ENAMEX>and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Finnish </ENAMEX>frontier are coming soon . 
3348 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Rianta </ENAMEX>is talking about similar joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tashkent </ENAMEX>and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sochi </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Black Sea </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">resort </ENAMEX>, and even has a computer - assembly project cooking with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Georgian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tbilisi </ENAMEX>. 
3531 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>' s international fleet of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">285 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes </ENAMEX>is being repainted and refurbished at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon Airport </ENAMEX>. 
3631 Thanks to a new air - traffic agreement and the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish </ENAMEX>travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents </ENAMEX>to issue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>tickets , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists </ENAMEX>here are taking advantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>' s reasonable prices to board flights in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon </ENAMEX>for holidays in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Havana </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kingston </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mexico City </ENAMEX>. 
3880 The round - trip fare to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Havana </ENAMEX>is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">410 Irish punts </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 578 </NUMEX>-RRB- . 
3937 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Jamaica </ENAMEX>costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">504 punts </NUMEX>. 
3964 A formal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing </ENAMEX>of sorts was bestowed on this friendship in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April </TIMEX>when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raisa Gorbachev </ENAMEX>stopped here for talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Haughey </ENAMEX>. 
4131 New trade accords were signed . 
4164 It all started with geography . 
4195 When it opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1939 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon </ENAMEX>was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">landfall </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>for thirsty <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">airplanes </ENAMEX>flying from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">North America </ENAMEX>. 
4309 Advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years </TIMEX>made a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon </ENAMEX>stop unnecessary for most Western air <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">fleets </ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>still flies inefficient <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">Ilyushins </ENAMEX>that ca n't make it from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Managua </ENAMEX>on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>hop . 
4525 As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ireland </ENAMEX>did n't spurn the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets </ENAMEX>after they shot down a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Korean Air Lines </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">jetliner </ENAMEX>over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Sea of Japan </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983 </TIMEX>, though it suspended direct <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon </ENAMEX>flights for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two months </TIMEX>. 
4717 In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Lingus </ENAMEX>started ferrying <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russians </ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>stripped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot </ENAMEX>of its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>landing rights . 
4852 Today , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Rianta </ENAMEX>is making a heap of money from its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX>friendship . 
4924 And , with those contacts in place , it could be relatively simple to add <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Lingus </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GPA </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">team </ENAMEX>. 
5028 Then , perhaps , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ovcharenko </ENAMEX>' s ideas would n't sound like so much blarney .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Consumers </ENAMEX>may want to move their telephones a little closer to the TV set . 
86 Couch - potato <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jocks </ENAMEX>watching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC </ENAMEX>' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Monday Night Football </ENAMEX>' can now vote during halftime for the greatest play in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 years </TIMEX>from among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>filmed replays . 
247 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two weeks ago </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime </TIMEX>consumer segments started calling a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>number for advice on various life - style issues . 
381 And the new syndicated ` reality ' show ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Hard Copy </ENAMEX>' records <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>' opinions for possible airing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next day </TIMEX>' s show . 
503 Interactive telephone technology has taken a new leap in sophistication , and television programmers are racing to exploit the possibilities . 
644 Eventually <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>may grow bored with the technology and resent the cost . 
719 But right now programmers are figuring that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>who are busy dialing up a range of services may put down their remote control zappers and stay tuned . 
875 ` We ' ve been spending a lot of time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX>talking to TV production <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Parks </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Call Interactive </ENAMEX>, which supplied technology for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC Sports </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">consumer minutes </TIMEX>. 
1081 ` With the competitiveness of the television market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">these days </TIMEX>, everyone is looking for a way to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>more excited . ' 
1206 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">leaders </ENAMEX>behind the expanded use of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>numbers is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Call Interactive </ENAMEX>, a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>of giants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Co . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co .  
1371 Formed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>weds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT &amp; T </ENAMEX>' s newly expanded <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>service with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 </NUMEX>voice - activated computers in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Omaha </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Neb . </ENAMEX>, service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">center </ENAMEX>. 
1528 Other long - distance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers </ENAMEX>have also begun marketing enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>service , and special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants </ENAMEX>are springing up to exploit the new tool . 
1671 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blair Entertainment </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>that advises TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations </ENAMEX>and sells ads for them , has just formed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>- - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">900 Blair </ENAMEX>- - to apply the technology to television . 
1843 The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">recent years </TIMEX>. 
1915 For a while , high - cost pornography lines and services that tempt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children </ENAMEX>to dial -LRB- and redial -RRB- movie or music information earned the service a somewhat sleazy image , but new legal restrictions are aimed at trimming excesses . 
2142 The cost of a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>call is set by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">originator </ENAMEX>- - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC Sports </ENAMEX>, for example - - with the cheapest starting at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents </NUMEX>. 
2260 Billing is included in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller </ENAMEX>' s regular phone bill . 
2314 From the fee , the local phone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>and the long - distance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier </ENAMEX>extract their costs to carry the call , passing the rest of the money to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">originator </ENAMEX>, which must cover advertising and other costs . 
2518 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent months </TIMEX>, the technology has become more flexible and able to handle much more volume . 
2613 Before , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>numbers would just listen and not talk , or they ' d vote ` yes ' or ` no ' by calling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>numbers . 
2736 -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>in the phone business call this technology ` <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>click . ' -RRB- 
2801 Now , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers </ENAMEX>are led through complex menus of choices to retrieve information they want , and the hardware can process <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 , 000 </NUMEX>calls in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 seconds </TIMEX>. 
2949 Up to now , <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>numbers have mainly been used on local TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations </ENAMEX>and cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">channels </ENAMEX>. 
3035 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MTV </ENAMEX>used one to give away the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">house </ENAMEX>that rock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Bon Jovi </ENAMEX>grew up in . 
3111 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting System </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cable News Network </ENAMEX>has invited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>to respond nightly to topical issues -LRB- ` Should the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">military </ENAMEX>intervene in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama </ENAMEX>? ' -RRB- , but even the hottest controversies on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>log <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 10 , 000 </NUMEX>calls . 
3359 The newest uses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>- interactive technology demonstrate the growing variety of applications . 
3458 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capital Cities </ENAMEX>\/ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC Inc . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Inc . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Broadcasting Co . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about hunger . 
3631 The subject will be written into the plots of prime - time shows , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>will be given a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>number to call . 
3743 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Callers </ENAMEX>will be sent educational booklets , and the call ' s modest cost will be an immediate method of raising money . 
3861 Other network applications have very different goals . 
3915 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC Sports </ENAMEX>was looking for ways to lift deflated halftime ratings for ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Monday Night Football </ENAMEX>. ' 
4010 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Sanger </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC Sports </ENAMEX>' s marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>, says that now ` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands </NUMEX>' of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans </ENAMEX>call its <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">each week </TIMEX>to vote for the best punt return , quarterback sack , etc . 
4187 Profit from the calls goes to charity , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC Sports </ENAMEX>also uses the calls as a sales tool : After thanking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers </ENAMEX>for voting , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gifford </ENAMEX>offers a football videotape for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 . 95 </NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers </ENAMEX>stay on the line to order it . 
4415 Jackets may be sold next . 
4443 Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC Sports </ENAMEX>recently began ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Scores Plus </ENAMEX>, ' a year - round , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 - hour </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>line providing a complex array of scores , analysis and fan news . 
4586 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said its purpose is ` to bolster the impression that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC Sports </ENAMEX>is always there for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>. ' 
4692 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>' s ` On - Line ' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">consumer minutes </TIMEX>have increased advertiser spending during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>' s weakest period . 
4806 Each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">weekday </TIMEX>matches a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sponsor </ENAMEX>and a topic : On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">Mondays </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unilever N . V . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lever Bros . </ENAMEX>sponsors tips on diet and exercise , followed by a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 - second </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lever Bros . </ENAMEX>commercial . 
4976 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Viewers </ENAMEX>can call a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>number for additional advice , which will be tailored to their needs based on the numbers they punch -LRB- ` Press <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>if you ' re pregnant , ' etc . -RRB- . 
5139 If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller </ENAMEX>stays on the line and leaves a name and address for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sponsor </ENAMEX>, coupons and a newsletter will be mailed , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sponsor </ENAMEX>will be able to gather a list of desirable potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>. 
5341 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane Seaman </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC - TV </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>has been able to charge premium rates for this ad time . 
5446 She would n't say what the premium is , but it ' s believed to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 % </NUMEX>above regular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daytime </TIMEX>rates . 
5547 ` We were able to get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>to use their promotion budget for this , because they get a chance to do couponing , ' says Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seaman </ENAMEX>. 
5681 ` And we were able to attract some new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>because this is something new . ' 
5765 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Call Interactive </ENAMEX>says TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>are considering the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>numbers for ` talk shows , game shows , news and opinion surveys . ' 
5909 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts </ENAMEX>are predicting a big influx of new shows in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>, when a service called ` automatic number information ' will become widely available . 
6050 This service identifies each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller </ENAMEX>' s phone number , and it can be used to generate instant mailing lists . 
6158 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Hard Copy </ENAMEX>, ' the new syndicated tabloid show from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paramount Pictures </ENAMEX>, will use its <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900 </ENAMEX>number for additional purposes that include research , says executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark B . von S . Monsky </ENAMEX>. 
6346 ` For a piece on local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II </ENAMEX>, we can ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>to leave the name and number of anyone they know who won a medal , ' he says . 
6486 ` That ' ll save us time and get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>involved . ' 
6536 But Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monsky </ENAMEX>sees much bigger changes ahead . 
6583 ` These are just baby steps toward real interactive video , which I believe will be the biggest thing yet to affect television , ' he says . 
6719 Although it would be costly to shoot multiple versions , TV programmers could let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences </ENAMEX>vote on different endings for a movie . 
6849 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fox Broadcasting </ENAMEX>experimented with this concept <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>of ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Married . . .

7238 ` You ' ll start to see shows where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>program the program .  

9 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commodity Futures Trading Commission </ENAMEX>plans to restrict dual trading on commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>, a move almost certain to infuriate exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>. 
174 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CFTC </ENAMEX>said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites ` problems ' associated with the practice . 
364 Dual trading gives an exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>the right to trade both for his own account and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>. 
467 The issue exploded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Bureau of Investigation </ENAMEX>operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange </ENAMEX>. 
653 While not specifically mentioned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI </ENAMEX>charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations . 
779 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics </ENAMEX>contend that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>' customer orders . 
905 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders . 
1068 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand . 
1226 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>say liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration . 
1369 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CFTC </ENAMEX>may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions . 
1460 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency </ENAMEX>did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed , but smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them . 
1637 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy Gramm </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>, told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Agriculture Committee </ENAMEX>that she expects the study to be released within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two weeks </TIMEX>and the rule changes to be completed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thanksgiving </TIMEX>. 
1826 The study , by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CFTC </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">division </ENAMEX>of economic analysis , shows that ` a trade is a trade , ' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member </ENAMEX>of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team </ENAMEX>said . 
1948 Whether a trade is done on a dual or non - dual basis , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member </ENAMEX>said , ` does n't seem to have much economic impact . ' 
2065 Currently , most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>on commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>specialize in trading either for customer accounts , which makes them <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers </ENAMEX>, or for their own accounts as socalled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals </ENAMEX>. 
2236 ` The tests indicate that dual and non - dual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market , ' Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gramm </ENAMEX>told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel </ENAMEX>. 
2411 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CFTC </ENAMEX>operations . 
2511 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>' s bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX>average volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 , 000 </NUMEX>contracts or more , comprising those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system . 
2713 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>bill would force the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CFTC </ENAMEX>to suspend dual trading if an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>ca n't show that its oversight system can detect dual - trading abuses . 
2860 So far , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>test of restricting dual trading has worked well . 
2922 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Merc </ENAMEX>banned dual trading in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 </NUMEX>- stock index futures <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">pit </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>. 
3021 Under the rules , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>. 
3141 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>who stand on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">pit </ENAMEX>' s top step , where most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer </ENAMEX>orders are executed , ca n't trade for themselves . 
3253 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">pit </ENAMEX>. 
3337 ` It ' s too soon to tell . . . but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>do n't seem to be unhappy with it , ' he said . 
3421 He said he would n't comment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CFTC </ENAMEX>plan until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>has seen the full proposal . 
3515 But at a meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Donovan </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Board of Trade </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>, told commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers </ENAMEX>: ` Dual trading is definitely worth saving . 
3654 It adds something to the market .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow PLC </ENAMEX>intends to change its name to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manpower PLC </ENAMEX>and write off a chunk of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 1 . 2 billion </NUMEX>in good will realized in the takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manpower Inc .  
194 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell Fromstein </ENAMEX>said in an interview that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>steps may be a prelude to reincorporating the world ' s biggest employment - services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
367 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein </ENAMEX>disclosed the planned steps , expected within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few months </TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>posted a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 . 5 % </NUMEX>drop in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>pretax earnings . 
513 The name change and good will write - off could help solidify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>' s dominance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>temporary - help market and give it a more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>image as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>turn jittery about foreign stocks after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s market plunge . 
746 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders </ENAMEX>now own <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 60 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last January </TIMEX>. 
826 ` In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>market , the recognition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manpower </ENAMEX>name is infinitely stronger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>, ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein </ENAMEX>said . 
947 The moves also could erase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>' perception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>in turmoil . 
1038 ` It further reinforces the concept that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>is a thing of the past , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Arthur </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder Peabody &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>. 
1180 The proposed changes ` all make a lot of sense to me , ' he added . 
1246 In a widely publicized boardroom coup , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein </ENAMEX>ousted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antony Berry </ENAMEX>as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a month </TIMEX>after Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry </ENAMEX>had forced Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein </ENAMEX>out as the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million </NUMEX>- a - year <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Milwaukee </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manpower </ENAMEX>. 
1474 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein </ENAMEX>solidified his control in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April </TIMEX>by taking over from Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry </ENAMEX>as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>. 
1565 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>tumult is n't over yet , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>is investigating a disputed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 25 million </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 39 . 4 million </NUMEX>-RRB- loan which Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein </ENAMEX>has said was made under Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry </ENAMEX>' s direction . 
1763 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>was able to pull off the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 34 billion </NUMEX>takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manpower </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>largely because different <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>. 
1966 Under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>rules , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>was able to write off at once the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 15 billion </NUMEX>in good will arising from the purchase . 
2086 As a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>would have to amortize the good will over as many as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">40 years </TIMEX>, creating a continuing drag on reported earnings . 
2236 Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets . 
2371 But with so many shares now held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>reports its earnings <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>ways , based on both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . K . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>accounting standards . 
2509 ` Our balance sheets look like they came from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice </ENAMEX>' s wonderland , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein </ENAMEX>said . 
2595 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>version shows ` a handful of pounds of net worth ' following the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>write - off of good will , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>version reflects ` <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion </NUMEX>of net worth because almost none of -LCB- the good will -RCB- has been written off . ' 
2824 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fromstein </ENAMEX>said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>books in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>fell swoop , but would n't specify how much . 
2969 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>suggested the write - down would represent a sizable chunk , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>claiming prior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management </ENAMEX>overstated the extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manpower </ENAMEX>' s good will . 
3145 That move , along with the return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manpower </ENAMEX>name , could bolster the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help . 
3290 The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>temporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 12 months ending Aug . 31 </TIMEX>, after sliding nearly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 . 5 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder Peabody </ENAMEX>' s Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur </ENAMEX>. 
3445 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Arrow </ENAMEX>blamed the pretax profit drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter ended July 31 </TIMEX>partly on slower earnings growth of non - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manpower </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>. 
3582 Overall , pretax profit slid to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 18 . 49 million </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 18 . 98 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>.

79 The ` social dimension ' - - worker concerns - - of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community </ENAMEX>' s plan to open its internal borders in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992 </TIMEX>could set the effort ` off the rails ' if not done reasonably , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric </ENAMEX>senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Doyle </ENAMEX>.

927 CLUBBING A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">FAN </ENAMEX>was n't the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baltimore </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Orioles </ENAMEX>' fault . 
981 So said a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge </ENAMEX>, in a case involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players </ENAMEX>for the minor league <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bluefield </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Orioles </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CITY">Baltimore </ENAMEX>farm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team </ENAMEX>. 
1107 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players </ENAMEX>were heckled by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron </ENAMEX>during a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 4 , 1988 </TIMEX>, game with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Martinsville </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Phillies </ENAMEX>. 
1204 Like its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">parent </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that year </TIMEX>, ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Bluefield </ENAMEX>was not having <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a good year </TIMEX>, ' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge </ENAMEX>said .

1398 More taunting in the parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">lot </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players </ENAMEX>said , led to a fight . 
1466 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan </ENAMEX>said he was punched and kicked by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player </ENAMEX>and that the other broke his jaw with a baseball bat . 
1573 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge </ENAMEX>dismissed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan </ENAMEX>' s suit against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team </ENAMEX>, however , ruling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Orioles </ENAMEX>innocent of negligent hiring , and not responsible for a fight that was outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players </ENAMEX>' employment . 
1760 PROPOSALS ARISE for coping with the shortage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses </ENAMEX>. 
1818 An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Association of Academic Health Centers </ENAMEX>report urges freeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses </ENAMEX>from duties that do n't require special skills . 
1935 It also recommends better retirement and day - care benefits , and basing pay on education , experience and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses </ENAMEX>' demanding work schedules . 
2073 But it opposes an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Medical Association </ENAMEX>proposal for creating a ` registered care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technologist </ENAMEX>, ' as ` potentially divisive ' ; it says the job would entail an unwanted new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor </ENAMEX>' s ` bedside ' extension . 
2280 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over a third </NUMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">618 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospitals </ENAMEX>surveyed by consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewitt Associates </ENAMEX>use a ` clinical ladder , ' basing advancement on performance and education . 
2425 Many also use recruiting bonuses , tuition reimbursement , loan repayment or child - care help . 
2517 Some give lump - sum incentives . 
2550 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MRA Staffing Systems </ENAMEX>signs up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses </ENAMEX>for paid travel , promising <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>income up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 , 000 </NUMEX>and free or subsidized housing . 
2676 TREATING <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">EMPLOYEES </ENAMEX>with respect is crucial for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>, says consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hay Group </ENAMEX>after surveys of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>.

812 But it said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Johnston </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ISI </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>, agreed to sell his <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 % </NUMEX>stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ISI </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Memotec </ENAMEX>upon completion of the tender offer for a combination of cash , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Memotec </ENAMEX>stock and debentures .

9 No strikeout , but certainly no home run . 
52 That ' s how the stock - picking game is shaping up for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the months ahead </TIMEX>, according to money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>and a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers </ENAMEX>. 
171 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88 </NUMEX>- point recovery from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s megadrop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones </ENAMEX>industrials had many brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses </ENAMEX>proclaiming that stocks are a good bargain again . 
329 But quite a few money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>are n't buying it . 
378 Weakening corporate earnings , they say , are no prescription for a bull market . 
459 ` The stock market ai n't going to do much of anything ' for a while , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Neff </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wellington Management </ENAMEX>, who runs the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 . 3 billion </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Windsor Fund </ENAMEX>. 
607 He suspects that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s market decline may have a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>leg , perhaps a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % to 15 % </NUMEX>drop later on . 
709 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neff </ENAMEX>says the stock market has lost some powerful driving forces , namely earnings growth and the ` LBO sweepstakes ' - - buy - out fever that induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>to bid up whole groups of stocks , such as media and airlines . 
930 After sitting with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 % </NUMEX>of his fund in cash before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s sell - off , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neff </ENAMEX>says he bought ` a narrow list of stocks ' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
1062 With flat corporate profits on the horizon for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>, money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>say price - earnings multiples that look cheap <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>might go on being cheap for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a long time </TIMEX>. 
1224 ` This is not a grossly overvalued market , but it ' s not cheap either , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Collins </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of the mutual fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T . Rowe Price Associates </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baltimore </ENAMEX>. 
1393 According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Institutional Brokers Estimate System </ENAMEX>, Wall Street market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists </ENAMEX>see only a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 . 4 % </NUMEX>jump in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>profits in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>- - unlike in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, when profits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year </TIMEX>out looked good -LRB- they did soar <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>-RRB- . 
1610 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bulls </ENAMEX>say the market is an incredible bargain , priced at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 12 </NUMEX>times estimated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>earnings for stocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 </NUMEX>index . 
1758 Before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash , the P \/ E was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20 </NUMEX>. 
1809 The common view , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby Cohen </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert </ENAMEX>, is that there will be ` mild economic growth , modest profit expansion , and things are going to be hunky - dory . 
1991 Our view is that we may see a profit decline . ' 
2038 Some think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>should sell into rallies . 
2085 The market ` is going to wind down , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald W . Perritt </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>. 
2170 ` Things are a little less overpriced ' after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s jolt in the market . 
2243 He expects stocks to decline <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an additional 5 % to 30 % </NUMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>perhaps bottoming out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 2000 and 2100 </NUMEX>` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between now and June </TIMEX>. ' 
2380 After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s decline , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perritt </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>ran statistical tests on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>high - quality stocks , using old - fashioned value criteria devised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Graham </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1930s </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1940s </TIMEX>who is widely considered to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father </ENAMEX>of modern securities analysis . 
2654 He found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85 </NUMEX>still overvalued and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 </NUMEX>fairly valued . 
2707 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Parks </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>, expects the market to decline <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 % </NUMEX>. 
2790 ` I ' ve been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two - thirds </NUMEX>in cash since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>, and I continue to think that having a defensive position is appropriate , ' he says . 
2915 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies </ENAMEX>that piled on debt in leveraged buy - outs during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two years </TIMEX>` will continue to surface as business problems . ' 
3043 ` Generalizations about value are n't useful , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John LeFrere </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta Capital Management </ENAMEX>. 
3158 For instance , he says , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys </ENAMEX>might look cheap , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>might continue to do better with stocks like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Walt Disney </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Procter &amp; Gamble </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca - Cola </ENAMEX>, strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">performers </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years </TIMEX>. 
3383 Money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Ross </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Duncan Ross Associates Ltd . </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Vancouver </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">British Columbia </ENAMEX>, says stocks would have to fall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 20 % </NUMEX>before they are competitive with less risky investment alternatives . 
3589 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fredric Russell </ENAMEX>, a money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tulsa </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Okla . </ENAMEX>, says <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s cave - in ` is going to have more of a permanent impact on the psyche of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>than Wall Street would want to admit . ' 
3779 There are still <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bulls </ENAMEX>out there . 
3812 ` I still think we will have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3000 </NUMEX>Dow , whether it ' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six months </TIMEX>or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12 months </TIMEX>from now I do n't know , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dreman </ENAMEX>, managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dreman Value Management </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>. 
3989 ` We ' re doing a little buying ' in some stocks ` that have really been smashed down . ' 
4074 Many brokerage house <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>also are optimistic . 
4126 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter </ENAMEX>all increased the proportion of assets they recommend <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>commit to stocks . 
4264 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter </ENAMEX>now recommends <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 % </NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 % </NUMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX>. 
4333 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s sell - off was a good thing , because it deflated a lot of crazy takeover speculation . 
4445 ` It was a healthy cleansing , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Holland </ENAMEX>, who runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Asset Management </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>. 
4555 From here out , these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>see a return to old - fashioned investing , based on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s ability to show profit growth . 
4681 ` The fundamentals are pretty strong , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dreman </ENAMEX>says . 
4736 ` I do n't see this as a bear market at all . 
4779 It ' s a recognition that there was much too much fluff in the LBO market . ' 
4855 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s big fall was ` just a blunder by the stock market , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Connolly </ENAMEX>, chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter </ENAMEX>. 
4969 ` It was an overreaction to an event -LCB- the failure of a management and union <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>to get bank financing for a takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>-RCB- that does n't mean that much to lots of stocks . ' 
5143 Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>have nagging worries , however . 
5189 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Newspapers </ENAMEX>are full of headlines about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>defaulting on their debts and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>writing off real estate loans . 
5305 That hurts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>' confidence in the economy and stocks . 
5367 Not even all the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>see clear sailing ahead . 
5425 ` Disappointing profits are likely to get worse in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next two quarters </TIMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Farrell </ENAMEX>, a market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber </ENAMEX>. 
5554 She thinks the market could drop <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few months </TIMEX>, then recover and go higher . 
5649 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies </ENAMEX>with steady earnings growth could do well , she says , while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">far more than 10 % </NUMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U . S . Banknote Co . </ENAMEX>said it again extended the expiration date of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 </NUMEX>- a - share tender offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Banknote Co . </ENAMEX>to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov . 15 </TIMEX>. 
146 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U . S . Banknote </ENAMEX>said it is in negotiations to sell ` certain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">facilities </ENAMEX>, ' which it did n't name , to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">party </ENAMEX>, and it needs the extension to try to reach a definitive agreement on the sale . 
336 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U . S . Banknote </ENAMEX>said it believes the sale , if completed , apparently would satisfy antitrust issues raised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . S . Justice Department </ENAMEX>about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U . S . Banknote </ENAMEX>' s offer to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Banknote </ENAMEX>. 
530 Both of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>print stock certificates and currency . 
608 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U . S . Banknote </ENAMEX>said ` there can be no assurance ' a sale agreement would be concluded . 
692 It also said the tender offer would probably have to be extended further to complete financing arrangements . 
801 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U . S . Banknote </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citibank </ENAMEX>extended the expiration date of its commitment for senior secured financing to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov . 15 </TIMEX>. 
919 The offer , made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1 </TIMEX>, has been extended several times . 
976 Closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U . S .

1138 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U . S . Banknote </ENAMEX>said that as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 13 </TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 . 1 million </NUMEX>shares , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 84 . 3 % </NUMEX>of the fully diluted shares outstanding , had been tendered .

114 Were it true that a weak currency paves the way for trade surpluses , then presumably <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Argentina </ENAMEX>would be the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">center </ENAMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>' s global economy .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>has been critical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>for not sending enough aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland </ENAMEX>, so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package . 
167 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>voted to send a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation </ENAMEX>of congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland </ENAMEX>to assist its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Sejm </ENAMEX>, in democratic procedures .

387 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Poles </ENAMEX>might do better to view it as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Trojan Horse </ENAMEX>. 
443 It is the vast shadow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 , 000 </NUMEX>congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers </ENAMEX>that helps create such legislative atrocities as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 376 </NUMEX>page , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">13 - pound </NUMEX>reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States </ENAMEX>. 
655 Maybe after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers </ENAMEX>explain their work to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Poles </ENAMEX>, they ' d be willing to come back and do the same for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Knight - Ridder Inc . </ENAMEX>said it would report increased earnings per share for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, contrary to reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>' comments that the publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s earnings would be down . 
197 A company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said he believed the confusion was caused when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Batten </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Knight - Ridder </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>, told <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two weeks ago </TIMEX>that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Knight - Ridder </ENAMEX>' s earnings per share for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first nine months of 1989 </TIMEX>would ` be behind a little bit ' from like period of 
488 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Knight - Ridder </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>earnings that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>plans to report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 24 </TIMEX>are expected to be up . 
612 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said he was ` comfortable ' with revised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>' projections that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>would report earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 62 cents and 64 cents </NUMEX>a share , compared with the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">53 cents </NUMEX>a share it reported for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 third quarter </TIMEX>. 
845 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Knight - Ridder </ENAMEX>said it agreed with estimates that net income for all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 2 . 86 </NUMEX>a share , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 59 </NUMEX>a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
998 In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>composite trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Knight - Ridder </ENAMEX>closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 51 . 75 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37 . 5 cents </NUMEX>.  

9 The stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp . </ENAMEX>continued to be pounded amid signs that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways </ENAMEX>may balk at any hasty reformulation of the aborted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 . 79 billion </NUMEX>buy - out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>. 
191 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>stock plummeted a further <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 24 . 875 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 198 </NUMEX>on volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2 . 8 million </NUMEX>shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>composite trading . 
325 The plunge followed a drop of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56 . 875 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>, amid indications the takeover may take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks </TIMEX>to be revived . 
433 The stock has fallen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 87 . 25 </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31 % </NUMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the three trading days </TIMEX>since announcement of the collapse of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 </NUMEX>- a - share takeover jolted the entire stock market into its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>- worst plunge ever . 
626 ` This is a total bloodbath ' for takeover - stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker </ENAMEX>said . 
712 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis </ENAMEX>, who put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United </ENAMEX>in play with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 4 billion </NUMEX>bid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two months ago </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night </TIMEX>proffered both a ray of hope and an extra element of uncertainty by saying he remains interested in acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>. 
937 But he dropped his earlier <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 </NUMEX>- a - share back - up bid , saying he must first explore bank financing . 
1037 Even as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase Manhattan Corp . </ENAMEX>scrambled to line up bank financing for a revised version of the lapsed labor - management bid , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways </ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner </ENAMEX>in the buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>, indicated it wants to start from scratch . 
1268 Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partners </ENAMEX>are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots </ENAMEX>, who were to own <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 % </NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management </ENAMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>. 
1352 Adding insult to injury , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 , 000 </NUMEX>- member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union </ENAMEX>, which helped scuttle financing for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>bid , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Wolf </ENAMEX>and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors </ENAMEX>to resign . 
1546 A similar demand was made by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>that represents some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 , 000 </NUMEX>noncontract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>. 
1646 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Peterpaul </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists </ENAMEX>union general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, attacked Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf </ENAMEX>as ` greedy and irresponsible ' for pursuing the buy - out . 
1777 Although Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Pope </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer </ENAMEX>, stood to pocket <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 114 . 3 million </NUMEX>for stock and options in the buy - out , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>planned to reinvest <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 15 million </NUMEX>in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
1984 The blue - collar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists </ENAMEX>, longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals </ENAMEX>of the white - collar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots </ENAMEX>, say the buyout would load the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>with debt and weaken its finances . 
2131 Confusion about the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>' hurried efforts to round up financing for a new bid that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>has n't even seen yet helped send <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>stock spiraling downward . 
2296 And rumors of forced selling by takeover - stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>triggered a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 </NUMEX>- point downdraft in the Dow Jones Industrial Average <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around 11 : 15 a . m . EDT </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
2453 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday </TIMEX>' s selling began after a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency </ENAMEX>reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>, which balked at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>bid , were ready to reject a revised version at around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 </NUMEX>a share , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 65 billion </NUMEX>. 
2650 Several reports as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>progressed gave vague or conflicting indications about whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>would sign up . 
2763 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp </ENAMEX>, for example , said only that it had ` expressions of interest of a transaction from both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>, ' but did n't have an agreement . 
2922 Late in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf </ENAMEX>issued a onepage statement calling Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterpaul </ENAMEX>' s blast ` divisive and uncalled for . ' 
3034 But he gave few details on the progress toward a new bid , saying only , ` We are working toward a revised proposal for majority employee ownership . ' 
3183 Meanwhile , in another sign that a new bid is n't imminent , it was learned that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>held a telephone meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>to hear an update on the situation , but that a formal board meeting is n't likely to be convened until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next week </TIMEX>. 
3428 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX>Lord <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King </ENAMEX>was quoted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Times </ENAMEX>as declaring he is ` not prepared to take my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>into a hasty deal . ' 
3575 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observers </ENAMEX>said it appeared that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air </ENAMEX>was angered at the way the bid has degenerated into confusion , as well as by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>' effort to round up financing for what one called ` a deal that is n't a deal . ' 
3786 The effort to revive the bid was complicated by the unwieldy nature of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>- party buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>. 
3887 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots </ENAMEX>were meeting outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
3938 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air </ENAMEX>, which was to have supplied <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million </NUMEX>out of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 965 million </NUMEX>in equity financing , apparently was n't involved in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>proposal and could well reject it even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>obtain financing . 
4145 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United </ENAMEX>' s noncontract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>said in a statement , ` The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf </ENAMEX>and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers </ENAMEX>were going to line their pockets with literally <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars </NUMEX>while instituting severe pay cuts on the nonunion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United </ENAMEX>is not only deplorable but inexcusable . ' 
4426 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists </ENAMEX>also asked for an investigation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission </ENAMEX>into possible securities - law violations in the original bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis </ENAMEX>, as well as in the response by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>. 
4632 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week </TIMEX>, just before the bank commitments were due , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union </ENAMEX>asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . S . Labor Department </ENAMEX>to study whether the bid violated legal standards of fairness governing employee investment funds . 
4829 In his statement , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf </ENAMEX>said , ` We continue to believe our approach is sound , and that it is far better for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>than the alternative of having an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outsider </ENAMEX>own the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>paying for it just the same . ' 
5059 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf </ENAMEX>has eschewed merger advice from a major Wall Street securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, relying instead only on a takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Atkins </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom </ENAMEX>. 
5233 The huge drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>stock prompted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>takeover stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Kellner </ENAMEX>, managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellner , DiLeo &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, to deny publicly rumors that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>was going out of business . 
5419 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kellner </ENAMEX>said that despite losses on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>stock , his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>' s health is ` excellent . ' 
5506 The stock ' s decline also has left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>in a quandary . 
5569 Although it may not be legally obligated to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>if the buy - out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>ca n't revive its bid , it may have to explore alternatives if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers </ENAMEX>come back with a bid much lower than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>' s original <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 </NUMEX>- a - share proposal . 
5806 At a meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 1 </TIMEX>to consider the labor - management bid , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>also was informed by its investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">adviser </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp . </ENAMEX>, of interest expressed by buy - out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">funds </ENAMEX>including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Forstmann Little &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, as well as by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bass </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley </ENAMEX>' s buy - out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">fund </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan Am Corp .  
6124 The takeover - stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>were hoping that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis </ENAMEX>or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of the other interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties </ENAMEX>might re - emerge with the situation in disarray , or that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>might consider a recapitalization . 
6320 Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>said they were still hesitant about accepting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp </ENAMEX>' s latest proposal .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp . </ENAMEX>said earnings tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, even a bit further than expected , rendering the outlook doubtful for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few quarters </TIMEX>. 
189 The main reason was a delay in shipment of new high - end disk drives , a business that accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">some 10 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60 billion </NUMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>revenue . 
338 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>, which telegraphed the poor results <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three weeks ago </TIMEX>, also cited an increase in its leasing business , which tends to lock in business long - term but cut revenue in the near term . 
519 In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars </NUMEX>. 
659 Earnings fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 877 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 51 </NUMEX>a share , somewhat below securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>' revised expectations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 1 . 60 </NUMEX>a share . 
790 That compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year - earlier </TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 25 billion </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 10 </NUMEX>a share - - which was inflated by a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 - cents </NUMEX>- a - share gain from the sale of some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI Communications Corp . </ENAMEX>stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fujitsu Ltd . </ENAMEX>relating to a software dispute . 
1052 Revenue climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 . 3 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14 . 31 billion </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13 . 71 billion </NUMEX>. 
1114 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Armonk </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . Y . </ENAMEX>, remained upbeat . 
1150 The computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant </ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>results have been dismal for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years </TIMEX>, noted that revenue rose again in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, following an increase in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>period . 
1325 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said in a statement that ` demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>products and services continues to be good world - wide . 
1433 We do not see anything in the fundamentals of our business that would cause us to change our strategy of investing for profitable growth . ' 
1574 Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>, however , remained downbeat . 
1623 ` I think <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">another mediocre year </TIMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Milunovich </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston </ENAMEX>. 
1710 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Stevens </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter </ENAMEX>actually cut his per - share earnings estimate to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 . 50 </NUMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>and to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 . 50 </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 . 35 </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>because he decided sales would be even weaker than he had expected . 
1909 Both estimates would mark declines from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 81 billion </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 . 80 </NUMEX>a share , which itself was well below the record <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984 </TIMEX>. 
2056 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens </ENAMEX>said he kept a ` buy \/ hold ' recommendation on the stock only because ` all the damage has been done . ' 
2167 He said the stock has n't traded below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>times book value over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past 10 years </TIMEX>, which at the moment computes to a stock price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 </NUMEX>. 
2307 The stock closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 103 </NUMEX>a share , up just <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 </NUMEX>in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>as the market surged . 
2438 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>worry that the disk - drive and leasing problems will last at least through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter </TIMEX>. 
2542 ` A key part of the question is , how soon does this disk - drive come and how soon does production ramp up ? ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Cohen </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SoundView Financial Group </ENAMEX>. 
2695 ` And the input I ' ve had from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers </ENAMEX>is that it still could be a while . ' 
2772 On leasing , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Djurdjevic </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Annex Research </ENAMEX>said he thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>has hurt itself unnecessarily . 
2867 He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>has priced its leases aggressively , thinking that would help win business . 
2954 But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>would have won the business anyway as a sale to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">party </ENAMEX>that would have then leased the equipment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer </ENAMEX>. 
3091 He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>has not only hurt its short - term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases . 
3200 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Bardagy </ENAMEX>, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>of marketing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Comdisco Inc . </ENAMEX>, a huge leasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, said : ` To put it mildly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM Credit </ENAMEX>has been doing some of the worst economic deals of any leasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>we have ever seen . ' 
3419 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>is expected to get a boost soon when it announces some new versions of its mainframes . 
3510 But the basic technology in the line is almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">five years old </TIMEX>, which means it is long in the tooth , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>are rolling out strong products of their own . 
3674 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>is gaining momentum in the personal - computer market , and is expected to introduce some impressive workstations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year </TIMEX>. 
3806 But it ' s hard to squeeze much profit out of the personal - computer business <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">these days </TIMEX>, and the workstation market , while important , is too small to rely on for much growth . 
3981 The disk drives will doubtless sell well when they finally become available . 
4058 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">AS \/ 400 </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>' s highly successful minicomputer line , is losing its momentum , and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>said sales could even decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter </TIMEX>. 
4212 In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>' s growth in software in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 8 . 8 % </NUMEX>, well below historical levels even when adjusted to reflect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>' s payment from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fujitsu </ENAMEX>and the stronger dollar . 
4403 And expenses , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 9 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>, have stayed stubbornly high . 
4472 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 17 billion </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 43 </NUMEX>a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 . 4 % </NUMEX>from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier </TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 46 billion </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 83 </NUMEX>a share . 
4601 Revenue increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 . 5 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 42 . 25 billion </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 39 . 68 billion </NUMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Agip S . p . A . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Societe National Elf Aquitaine </ENAMEX>, the state oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>, respectively , submitted an offer to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gatoil Suisse S . A .  
162 The price was n't disclosed . 
192 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gatoil </ENAMEX>said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss </ENAMEX>oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>was examining the offer , submitted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday </TIMEX>, along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>other offers , also submitted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>. 
350 Those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>offers were private and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>refused to identify the bidding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>. 
443 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>further said that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two </NUMEX>more offers are expected from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two weeks </TIMEX>. 
554 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gatoil Suisse </ENAMEX>owns an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refinery </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Switzerland </ENAMEX>with a capacity of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">70 , 000 barrels </NUMEX>a day , along with a network of gasoline retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR Corp . </ENAMEX>reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>net income , citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip . 
142 Net income for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 93 . 1 million </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 103 . 1 million </NUMEX>, roughly what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>had expected . 
248 But per - share profit dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 23 </NUMEX>a share from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 26 </NUMEX>a share , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>continued its stock buy - back plan . 
372 Average shares outstanding dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75 . 8 million </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82 . 1 million </NUMEX>. 
442 Revenue fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 39 billion </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 41 billion </NUMEX>. 
497 The computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>, which sells <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half </NUMEX>its goods outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>, also said the negative effect of a stronger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>dollar will ` adversely affect ' its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth - quarter </TIMEX>performance and ` make it difficult ' to better <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>results . 
733 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR </ENAMEX>said revenue declined both in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>and overseas , reflecting a world - wide softening of the computer markets . 
849 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, however , said orders in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>showed ` good gains ' during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter </TIMEX>. 
942 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>estimate those gains at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 % to 13 % </NUMEX>, a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR </ENAMEX>' s major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">customers </ENAMEX>. 
1074 In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR </ENAMEX>, which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers , is also affected by the retail and financial sectors , ` areas of the economy that have generally not been robust , ' notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanjiv G . Hingorani </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc .  
1389 These factors , combined with a strong dollar , should negatively affect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the current quarter </TIMEX>' s results , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR </ENAMEX>said . 
1501 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year - earlier fourth quarter </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR </ENAMEX>had profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 149 . 6 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 85 </NUMEX>a share , on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 8 billion </NUMEX>. 
1619 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hingorani </ENAMEX>said he lowered his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">full - year </TIMEX>estimates for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 35 </NUMEX>a share from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 50 </NUMEX>a share . 
1719 Revenue projections were slashed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 . 03 billion </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 . 20 billion </NUMEX>. 
1789 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR </ENAMEX>had net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 439 . 3 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 33 </NUMEX>a share , on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 99 billion </NUMEX>in revenue . 
1887 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months </TIMEX>, the company ' s earnings fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 264 . 6 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 40 </NUMEX>a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 289 . 7 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 49 </NUMEX>a share . 
2015 Revenues declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 17 billion </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 19 billion </NUMEX>. 
2075 In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>composite trading yesterday , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR </ENAMEX>shares fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents </NUMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57 </NUMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debora Foster </ENAMEX>takes off her necklace , settles herself on a padded chair and gently leans forward . 
107 With a jazz - piano tape playing softly in the background , the soothing hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sabina Vidunas </ENAMEX>begin to work on Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foster </ENAMEX>' s neck and shoulders . 
251 ` It ' s like an oasis in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room </ENAMEX>, ' Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foster </ENAMEX>purrs . 
304 The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room </ENAMEX>in question is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lounge </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">H . J . Heinz Co . </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">floors </ENAMEX>above the bustle of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh </ENAMEX>. 
411 There , amid oil paintings and marble tables , massages are administered every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday </TIMEX>. 
501 ` On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days </TIMEX>that I ' m really busy , ' says Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foster </ENAMEX>, who works in public relations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, ` it seems decadent to take time off for a massage . ' 
651 Although such sessions may never replace coffee breaks , on - site massage , as it is known in the trade , is certainly infiltrating corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America </ENAMEX>. 
798 In some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>sneak massage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">therapists </ENAMEX>into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>, fearful that upper - level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>wo n't approve . 
927 Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foster </ENAMEX>' s indulgence is nothing like the oily , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour </TIMEX>- long rubfests enjoyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">spa </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors </ENAMEX>. 
1021 Nor does it at all resemble -LRB- despite what some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>think -RRB- the more intimate variety offered at specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parlors </ENAMEX>in bad parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town </ENAMEX>. 
1163 On the contrary , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>rubdowns usually take place in dimly lighted conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms </ENAMEX>, where stressed - out <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>relax in specially designed chairs , fully clothed . 
1330 The massages <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last 15 minutes </TIMEX>and typically cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 10 </NUMEX>. 
1391 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Heinz </ENAMEX>, even pay part of the fee . 
1450 Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vidunas </ENAMEX>has been seeing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 15 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>a visit since the program was started at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Heinz </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>. 
1552 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony J . F . O ' Reilly </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>, swears by her firm touch , saying regular massages are a balm for his old football injuries . 
1693 Massage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates </ENAMEX>say that kneading the head , shoulders , neck and back can go a long way toward easing tension and improving morale . 
1826 They also insist that touching is a basic need , as powerful as the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food </ENAMEX>or sleep , and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>is as good a place as any to do it . 
1973 ` The blood flows to your head , you feel lightheaded and you do n't feel tension around the head or neck , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minnie Morey </ENAMEX>, an operations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Grand Rapids </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich . </ENAMEX>, where massages began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>. 
2209 ` When you leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room </ENAMEX>after your massage , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>say you look like you ' re glowing . ' 
2296 Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candice Ohlman </ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">35 - year - old </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseuse </ENAMEX>who plies her trade in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Grand Rapids </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>, ` They fall in love with my hands . ' 
2427 Not everyone , however , is at ease with office massage . 
2482 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Three years ago </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Internal Revenue Service </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Jose </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, opened its doors to on - site massage . 
2595 And even though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>paid the bill , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers </ENAMEX>grumbled . 
2658 ` Sometimes , with the release of stress , you hear ` oohs ' and ` ahs ' coming out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room </ENAMEX>, ' explains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Banks </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency </ENAMEX>' s health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist </ENAMEX>. 
2804 ` And you ca n't have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers </ENAMEX>coming into an audit hearing ` oohs ' and ` ahs . ' ' 
2885 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month </TIMEX>, the complaints intensified and the massages ended . 
2948 ` Now we ' re looking for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room </ENAMEX>with thicker walls , ' Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks </ENAMEX>says . 
3017 Massage also has an image problem to contend with . 
3068 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseurs </ENAMEX>have tried to get around this by calling themselves ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodyworkers </ENAMEX>' and describing their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>visits as ` reinvigoration breaks . ' 
3211 But massage , no matter how chaste , is still associated in many minds with seedy fronts for prostitution , and that makes some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>nervous . 
3358 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year </TIMEX>, the research and development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weyerhaeuser Co . </ENAMEX>, the large wood - products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>, invited a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseuse </ENAMEX>to its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tacoma </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wash . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices </ENAMEX>. 
3511 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Harms </ENAMEX>, a software <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer </ENAMEX>, was an eager <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer </ENAMEX>. 
3567 ` You build up a lot of tension working at a terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">all day </TIMEX>, ' he says . 
3641 But after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about eight months </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Soule </ENAMEX>, learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt . 
3772 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soule </ENAMEX>says his only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beef </ENAMEX>was that the massages were being given in a company conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room </ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department </ENAMEX>' s supervised health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility </ENAMEX>would have been fine . 
3936 ` In my view , -LCB- massages -RCB- should be managed with an appropriate mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females </ENAMEX>around , ' he says . 
4047 Given such attitudes , some corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseurs </ENAMEX>prefer to go about their business quietly . 
4136 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell Borner </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Park Ridge </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . J . </ENAMEX>, says he has been working for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past year </TIMEX>at a huge chemical and manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>- - unbeknownst to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>. 
4316 He visits the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department </ENAMEX>every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">two or three weeks </TIMEX>. 
4372 His massage chair is kept in a closet , and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>escorts him past <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">security </ENAMEX>. 
4456 ` This is common with a lot of large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>, ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Borner </ENAMEX>, who worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co . </ENAMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">23 years </TIMEX>before choosing his current trade . 
4619 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers </ENAMEX>, he contends , ` are afraid how they ' re going to look in the eyes of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers </ENAMEX>. 
4708 My vision is to change human consciousness towards touch . 
4766 My attitude is : Let ' s come out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">closet </ENAMEX>. ' 
4815 Occasionally , all that ' s needed is a little coaxing . 
4868 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elisa Byler </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St . Louis </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseuse </ENAMEX>, won over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Emerson Electric Co . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of electrical and electronic equipment , by providing documents and other articles trumpeting the therapeutic benefits of massage . 
5085 She notes that she also stresses professionalism during her weekly visits . 
5162 ` I pull my hair back , wear a little makeup and look corporate , ' says Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byler </ENAMEX>, who has been visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Emerson </ENAMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January </TIMEX>. 
5287 ` If I go in there as I normally dress , they ' d ask , ` Who is this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippie </ENAMEX>? ' ' 
5364 The self - proclaimed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father </ENAMEX>of on - site massage is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Palmer </ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">41 - year - old </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseur </ENAMEX>whose mission is to save the touch - starved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses </ENAMEX>. 
5514 To help do this , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmer </ENAMEX>developed a portable massage chair <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago </TIMEX>that he hopes will bring ` structured touching ' into mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America </ENAMEX>. 
5667 ` The culture is not ready to take off its clothes , lie down and be touched for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour </TIMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45 </NUMEX>, ' he says . 
5773 ` The idea is to keep the clothes on and to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>seated . 
5836 The chair is a way to package massage . ' 
5878 Sitting in one of Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmer </ENAMEX>' s chairs , which cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 425 </NUMEX>and have since been copied by others , is a bit like straddling a recliner . 
6008 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Customers </ENAMEX>lean forward , rest their knees on side supports and bury their face in padding on the back of the chair . 
6123 -LRB- Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ohlman </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Grand Rapids </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseuse </ENAMEX>, says she has heard the odd - looking contraption compared to something out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Spanish Inquisition </ENAMEX>. -RRB- 
6267 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmer </ENAMEX>, who serves as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">On - Site Massage Association </ENAMEX>and writes an industry newsletter , says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 4 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners </ENAMEX>- - out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50 , 000 </NUMEX>certified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseurs </ENAMEX>across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>- - now use massage chairs in the workplace , as well as on street <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">corners </ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">malls </ENAMEX>, and at conventions and other gatherings where weary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>can be found . 
6636 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scot MacInnis </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseur </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boulder </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colo . </ENAMEX>, had a scary experience while massaging a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>in a natural - foods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supermarket </ENAMEX>as part of a store promotion . 
6786 <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three minutes </TIMEX>into the massage , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>curled up , began shaking and turned red . 
6867 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Paramedics </ENAMEX>were called . 
6893 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A week later </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>told Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacInnis </ENAMEX>he had suffered a mild heart attack unrelated to the massage . 
6997 ` It was a powerful point in my career , ' says the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">31 - year - old </TIMEX>Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacInnis </ENAMEX>, who has since taken out a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million </NUMEX>liability policy for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business </ENAMEX>. 
7144 ` But he pulled through , and after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ambulance </ENAMEX>left , there were still <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>in line waiting for a massage . 
7257 The next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman </ENAMEX>was older , and I was afraid to touch her . 
7314 But it ' s like falling off a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse </ENAMEX>and getting back on . ' 
7372 Despite the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans </ENAMEX>that office massage has won , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists </ENAMEX>look down on it , arguing that naked , full - body rubs are the only way to go . 
7517 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Aldridge </ENAMEX>, who does full - body work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh </ENAMEX>, says that while on - site massage is better than nothing , tired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>should realize it is only the tip of the iceberg . 
7694 ` Whole areas of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies </ENAMEX>are neglected , ' she says , adding that clothes ruin the experience . 
7790 ` There ' s nothing like skin to skin .

286 Despite continuing troubles with problem properties and nonperforming loans , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust </ENAMEX>said it has rebuilt reserves , abandoned properties with little potential and experienced improved operating results from joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures </ENAMEX>.

388 Pershare net fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">423 . 3 yen </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">457 . 7 yen </NUMEX>because of expenses and capital adjustments . 
481 Without detailing specific product breakdowns , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nintendo </ENAMEX>credited its bullish upsurge in sales - - including advanced computer games and television entertainment systems - - to surging ` leisure - oriented ' sales in foreign markets . 
708 Export sales for leisure items alone , for instance , totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">184 . 74 billion yen </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the 12 months </TIMEX>, up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106 . 06 billion </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous fiscal year </TIMEX>.

9 The roller - coaster stock market is making life tougher for small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>trying to raise money . 
109 In the wake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s rebound , some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>are already postponing deals , and others wish they could . 
238 As in other jittery times , many small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses </ENAMEX>expect a particularly rough time raising funds as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>shun risky deals , seeking safety in bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>. 
403 Even if stock prices fully recover from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s sharp decline , the unsettled conditions will frighten many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>. 
524 ` The implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Linsert Jr . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Martek Corp . </ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">four - year - old </TIMEX>biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>that is planning a private placement of stock . 
746 ` The more variables that indicate risk , the more the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX>is going to drive a hard bargain . ' 
845 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this month </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Staples Inc . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newton </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass . </ENAMEX>, office - supplies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">discounter </ENAMEX>, said it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public </ENAMEX>. 
1019 At the time , its shares were selling above their initial offering price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 </NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>believed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Staples </ENAMEX>would sell new stock without a hitch . 
1168 But with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s shares standing at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, a new offering seems unlikely , company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>say . 
1279 Business , however , continues to be ` robust , ' and the stock market has n't affected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>' s expansion plans , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd Krasnow </ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>. 
1433 Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>figure they ca n't avoid the market . 
1485 ` We have capital requirements , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linsert </ENAMEX>, ` so we have to go ahead ' with a planned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 5 billion </NUMEX>private placement . 
1607 Unless the market goes right back up , he says , ` it may take us <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six to nine months </TIMEX>to find the money , instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>. ' 
1727 And the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Columbia </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Md . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>may have to settle for a lower price , he adds . 
1807 Life is particularly nerve - racking for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>that had planned to go public <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>. 
1897 Hand - holding is becoming an investment - banking job requirement . 
1963 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robertson , Stephens &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX>investment banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>, has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client </ENAMEX>that looked forward to making its initial public offering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
2116 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officers </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, a health - care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>, ` were very discouraged on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>and felt they should n't go public ; we felt they should , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford Robertson </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>in the banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>. 
2312 As the market dropped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robertson Stephens </ENAMEX>slashed the value of the offering by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 % </NUMEX>. 
2402 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday </TIMEX>, when similar securities rebounded , it bumped the valuation up again . 
2482 As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday </TIMEX>, the IPO was still on . 
2528 For many , the situation is especially discouraging because the market for IPOs was showing signs of strengthening after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years </TIMEX>of weakness . 
2675 ` We were just beginning to look at the increase in IPOs , seeing the light at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">tunnel </ENAMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Kline Jr . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lambda Funds </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, venture capital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>. 
2873 ` But the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">tunnel </ENAMEX>' s just gotten longer . ' 
2914 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies </ENAMEX>planning to go public ` are definitely taking a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>look , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Hadhazy </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Institute for Econometric Research </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fort Lauderdale </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla . </ENAMEX>, which publishes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Issues </ENAMEX>newsletter on IPOs . 
3137 He calculates that the recent market slide translated into a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % to 7 % </NUMEX>reduction in IPO proceeds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>. 
3249 Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>are hesitating . 
3280 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exabyte Corp . </ENAMEX>had been planning to sell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>of its stock <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>in an IPO that would raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 28 . 5 million </NUMEX>. 
3395 But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Behrendt </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>, says , ` We ' re making decisions on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day </TIMEX>- to - <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day </TIMEX>basis . ' 
3485 Debt - free and profitable , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boulder </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colo . </ENAMEX>, computer - products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>could borrow funds if it decides against an IPO <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now </TIMEX>, he says . 
3621 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KnowledgeWare Inc . </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta </ENAMEX>computer - software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>, says it is still planning to go ahead with its IPO <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>or next - - unless conditions change . 
3777 ` It ' s a wait - and - see situation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">right now </TIMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry McGowan </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>. 
3853 Delayed financings also would affect the operations of many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>. 
3924 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sierra Tucson Cos . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tucson </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator </ENAMEX>of addiction - treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">centers </ENAMEX>, has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an IPO scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week </TIMEX>. 
4079 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William O ' Donnell </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>, says he still thinks the IPO will succeed . 
4152 If it does n't , he says , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>would have to change its expansion timetable . 
4236 But the market turmoil could be partially beneficial for some small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses </ENAMEX>. 
4316 In a sagging market , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve System </ENAMEX>` might flood the market with funds , and that should bring interest rates down , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard T . Anctil </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of New England </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston </ENAMEX>. 
4521 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James G . Zafris </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Danvers Savings Bank </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Danvers </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass . </ENAMEX>, says the market turmoil ` is an absolute non - event for small business . ' 
4660 For small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>, he says , interest rates are far more important than what happens on stock exchanges . 
4766 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zafris </ENAMEX>thinks rates are heading down , helping small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>. 
4835 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Drake </ENAMEX>, biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vector Securities International </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>, thinks market uncertainty may encourage small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>to form more strategic alliances with big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>. 
5028 Partly because the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>market crash made it harder for them to find financing , many high - technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns </ENAMEX>have made such alliances recently . 
5173 Some even see a silver lining in the dark clouds . 
5223 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Wells </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bollinger , Wells , Lett &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>merger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">specialist </ENAMEX>, thinks panicky <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy - out and giant takeover deals . 
5407 Instead , they could turn to investing in smaller deals involving smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>, he says . 
5502 And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William E . Wetzel Jr . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of New Hampshire </ENAMEX>management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Venture Capital Network Inc . </ENAMEX>, says the market ' s gyrations will underline the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>' lack of control in big stock investments . 
5726 This will add to the appeal of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business </ENAMEX>, he says , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>often have a degree of influence .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies </ENAMEX>listed below reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly </TIMEX>profit substantially different from the average of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>' estimates . 
123 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>are followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>, and had a minimum <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five - cent </NUMEX>change in actual earnings per share . 
243 Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted . 
304 The percent difference compares actual profit with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 - day </TIMEX>estimate where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>have issues forecasts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past 30 days </TIMEX>. 
448 Otherwise , actual profit is compared with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">300 - day </TIMEX>estimate .  

9 For the moment , at least , euphoria has replaced anxiety on Wall Street . 
83 The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2657 . 38 </NUMEX>, panic did n't sweep the world ' s markets , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>large and small seemed to accept <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s dizzying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 </NUMEX>- point plunge as a sharp correction , not a calamity . 
323 Many went bargain - hunting . 
352 Among those sighing with relief was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John H . Gutfreund </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers </ENAMEX>, who took to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>' s trading floor to monitor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s events . 
505 As the rally gained strength at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 : 15 p . m . </TIMEX>, he smiled broadly , brandished his unlit cigar and slapped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Shopkorn </ENAMEX>, his top stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>, on the back . 
661 At <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>, it seemed as if history might repeat itself . 
716 As trading opened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning </TIMEX>on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>, stocks of many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>could n't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>. 
900 By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 : 10 </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Industrials </ENAMEX>were off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 . 52 </NUMEX>points , and the stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp . </ENAMEX>, whose troubles had kicked off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge , still had n't opened . 
1051 But then , as quickly as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>had fallen , it began to turn around . 
1120 It ended with a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88 . 12 </NUMEX>points . 
1160 By the market ' s close , volume on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 416 million </NUMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth </NUMEX>highest on record . 
1276 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>handled the huge volume without any obvious strain , in sharp contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>. 
1385 But the rally was largely confined to the blue - chip stocks , which had been hard hit during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s selling frenzy . 
1501 Overall , more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>stocks lost money than gained . 
1558 And many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers </ENAMEX>, already reeling from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>deal , were further hurt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>when a proposed takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp . </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines </ENAMEX>, collapsed . 
1747 Indeed , the Dow Jones Transportation Average plunged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 . 06 </NUMEX>points , its second - worst drop in history . 
1851 World - wide , trading was generally manageable . 
1897 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt </ENAMEX>stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>was hardest hit of the major markets , with blue chips there falling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 . 8 % </NUMEX>. 
2001 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday </TIMEX>rally left the market ' s major index off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 . 2 % </NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>' s leading stock index fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1 . 8 % </NUMEX>in surprisingly lackluster trading . 
2150 Other , more thinly traded <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian </ENAMEX>markets were hit harder than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>' s , but there were no free - fall declines . 
2260 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors </ENAMEX>big and small say they learned valuable lessons since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash : In this age of computerized trading , huge corrections or runups in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours </TIMEX>' time must be expected . 
2443 What ' s more , such short - term cataclysms are survivable and are no cause for panic selling . 
2536 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Boesel </ENAMEX>, a major money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T . Rowe Price </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baltimore </ENAMEX>, says , ` There was less panic than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>: We had been through it once . ' 
2678 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Somerset </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wis . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adrian Sween </ENAMEX>, who owns a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supplier </ENAMEX>of nursing - home equipment and is n't active in the stock market , agrees . 
2803 ` I look at it as a ho - hum matter , ' he says . 
2849 Many other factors played a part in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s comeback . 
2907 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve </ENAMEX>signaled its willingness to provide liquidity ; the interest rate on its loans to major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>inched downward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early in the day </TIMEX>. 
3054 Foreign stock markets , which kicked off <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>with a huge selling spree , began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>off by relatively modest amounts . 
3182 The dollar , after falling sharply in overnight trading to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">139 . 10 yen </NUMEX>, bounced back strongly to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">141 . 8 </NUMEX>, thus easing fears that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners </ENAMEX>would unload <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>stocks . 
3346 And the widely disseminated opinion among most market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts </ENAMEX>that a crash was n't in store also helped calm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>. 
3465 Many major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>, for example , came into work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>ready to buy some of the blue chips they felt had been sharply undervalued on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
3616 Still , amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s events , some market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals </ENAMEX>cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s . 
3840 ` There is too much complacency , ' says money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Schrager </ENAMEX>. 
3910 Computers have increasingly connected securities markets world - wide , so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed around the globe . 
4060 So <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>everywhere nervously eyed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s opening in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>, where the Nikkei average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225 </NUMEX>blue - chip stocks got off to a rocky start . 
4204 The average plunged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 600 </NUMEX>points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 7 % </NUMEX>, in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes </TIMEX>of trading . 
4286 But the selling wave had no conviction , and the market <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>surged upward by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 </NUMEX>points , then drifted lower , closing down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">647 </NUMEX>. 
4416 Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>, most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>' s major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>chose to sit this calamity out . 
4502 In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>trading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room </ENAMEX>, some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>and assistants sat quietly , with few orders to process . 
4620 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Clients </ENAMEX>` are all staying out ' of the market , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>says . 
4692 The relative calm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>proved little comfort to markets opening up in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>. 
4774 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt </ENAMEX>' s opening was delayed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half hour </TIMEX>because of a crush of sell orders . 
4853 ` The beginning was chaotic , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Longley </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commerzbank  
4929 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>, the view from the trading floor of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferies &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, also was troubling . 
5041 A computer screen displaying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>blue - chip stocks colors each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>red when its price is falling . 
5138 The screen was a sea of red . 
5167 ` I see concern , but I do n't see panic , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J . Francis Palamara </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">New Yorker </ENAMEX>who runs the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 </NUMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>. 
5277 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>' s blue - chip stock index turned up just before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 a . m . </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>time , sending an encouraging message to Wall Street . 
5401 When trading opened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 : 30 a . m . EDT </TIMEX>, stocks fell sharply - - as expected . 
5487 Futures markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>had opened at a level suggesting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>would fall by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 60 </NUMEX>points . 
5586 With sell orders piled up from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half </NUMEX>the stocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>could n't open on time . 
5681 By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 : 45 </TIMEX>, the industrial average had dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 </NUMEX>points . 
5736 By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 a . m . </TIMEX>, it was down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 </NUMEX>. 
5764 <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ten minutes </TIMEX>later , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>hit bottom - down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 . 52 </NUMEX>points , another <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 . 5 % </NUMEX>. 
5837 But shortly before then , some of Wall Street ' s sharpest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>say , they sensed a turn . 
5926 ` The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>thing that caught my eye that was encouraging was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bonds were off , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austin George </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of stock trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T . Rowe Price </ENAMEX>. 
6073 ` It meant that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>were n't running pell - mell to the safety of bonds . ' 
6148 Shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 a . m . </TIMEX>, the Major Market Index , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade </ENAMEX>futures contract of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 </NUMEX>stocks designed to mimic the DJIA , exploded upward . 
6295 Stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>were buoyed - - because an upturn in the MMI had also started the recovery in stocks on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday </TIMEX>following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>. 
6434 ` The MMI has gone better , ' shouted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton </ENAMEX>. 
6526 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>trading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room </ENAMEX>went wild . 
6568 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>shouted out as their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reuters </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Telerate </ENAMEX>screens posted an ever - narrowing loss on Wall Street . 
6681 Then , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine minutes </TIMEX>later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>. 
6760 ` Rally , rally , rally , ' shouted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Rosen </ENAMEX>. 
6814 ` This is panic buying . ' 
6838 Major blue - chip stocks like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Proctor &amp; Gamble </ENAMEX>led the rally . 
6934 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>were said to be heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>. 
6973 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Dutch </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>reportedly loaded up on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg Co .  
7036 Then , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>say , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>with share buy - back programs kicked into high gear , triggering gains in , among other issues , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alcan Aluminium </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald ' s </ENAMEX>. 
7195 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Walt Disney Co . </ENAMEX>, which had one of the biggest sell - order imbalances on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>and was one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX>stocks that halted trading and never reopened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day </TIMEX>, opened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>late at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114 . 5 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 . 5 </NUMEX>. 
7392 But then it suddenly burst upward <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 . 5 </NUMEX>as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>stepped in and bought almost every share offer , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>said . 
7518 By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 : 25 </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>had turned up for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>, prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors . 
7618 Among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>, the cry was ` Pull your offers ' - - meaning that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>soon expected to get higher prices for their shares . 
7761 ` It was bedlam on the upside , ' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist </ENAMEX>. 
7823 ` What we had was a real , old - fashioned rally . ' 
7872 This technical strength spurred buying from Wall Street ' s ` black boxes , ' computer programs designed to trigger large stock purchases during bullish periods . 
8029 Typical , perhaps , was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Batterymarch </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean LeBaron </ENAMEX>. 
8080 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LeBaron </ENAMEX>, who manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion </NUMEX>, says , ` We turned the trading system on , and it did whatever it was programmed to do . ' 
8204 Asked what stocks the computer bought , the money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>says , ` I do n't know . ' 
8285 Not everybody was making money . 
8317 The carnage on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Board Options Exchange </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s major options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">market </ENAMEX>, was heavy after the trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>stock - index options was halted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
8481 Many market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>index options contract had bullish positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses . 
8630 Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>, clearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>told the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>to get out of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions </ENAMEX>at any cost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning </TIMEX>. 
8754 ` They were absolutely killed , slaughtered , ' said one <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>- based options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trader </ENAMEX>. 
8839 Meanwhile , a test of the stock market ' s rally came at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 2 p . m . </TIMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2600 </NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 </NUMEX>points on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>. 
8954 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Clough </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch </ENAMEX>, says bargain hunting had explained the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>' s strength up to that point and that many market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals </ENAMEX>were anticipating a drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>. 
9144 Moreover , the announcement that real estate magnate and sometime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raider </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump </ENAMEX>was withdrawing his offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp . </ENAMEX>might have been expected to rattle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>. 
9315 Instead , the rally only paused for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 25 minutes </TIMEX>and then steamed forward as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>resumed buying . 
9424 The market closed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes </TIMEX>after reaching its high for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX>of 
9491 Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s events in stride , while remaining generally uneasy about the stock market in general .

9739 While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman </ENAMEX>found the market ' s performance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>reassuring , he says , he remains uneasy . 
9836 ` We have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts </ENAMEX>saying one thing and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>the other ' about the course of the economy . 
9934 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Holzfaster </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer </ENAMEX>and farm - supply store <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ogallala </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Neb . </ENAMEX>, says of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">last few days </TIMEX>events , ` If anything good comes out of this , it might be that it puts some of these LBOs on the skids . ' 
10143 Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon Fines </ENAMEX>, a money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IDS Financial Services </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis </ENAMEX>, ` You ' re on a roller coaster , and that may last . 
10268 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public </ENAMEX>is still cautious .  

9 The continuing series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD </ENAMEX>scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork - barrel politics . 
102 Nevertheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">lobbies </ENAMEX>such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">National Association of Home Builders </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB </ENAMEX>-RRB- continue to pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill </ENAMEX>for more special - interest spending . 
253 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kent Colton </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB </ENAMEX>executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, argues that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>faces a multifaceted housing crisis - - reduced affordability of homes for first - time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>, increased homelessness , and lower apartment construction rates - - that will be ` very difficult ' to solve ` without expanded federal resources . ' 
556 There ' s nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending . 
640 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB </ENAMEX>was created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1943 </TIMEX>out of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">organization </ENAMEX>that made its name fighting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roosevelt </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>proposal to take over all defense housing production . 
805 Through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years </TIMEX>the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">association </ENAMEX>has been an active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">member </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">coalition </ENAMEX>, pushing for such initiatives as the balanced - budget amendment . 
957 Yet on matters close to , er , home   . 
999 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD </ENAMEX>budget has dropped by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 70 % </NUMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980 </TIMEX>, ' argues Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colton </ENAMEX>. 
1076 ` We ' ve taken more than our fair share . 
1115 I would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit . ' 
1187 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB </ENAMEX>support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch ; over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years </TIMEX>the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB </ENAMEX>has backed a host of public programs . 
1326 It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>and has regularly advanced anti - recession housing measures . 
1470 Moreover , explains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB </ENAMEX>remains susceptible to internal pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>that specialize in subsidized production . 
1614 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">association </ENAMEX>is pushing an extensive and expensive wish - list , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 15 billion </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually </TIMEX>. 
1781 It would like to peg the ceiling on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Housing Administration </ENAMEX>mortgage guarantees to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 % </NUMEX>of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 101 , 250 </NUMEX>; reduce -LRB- or even eliminate -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA </ENAMEX>down - payment requirements and increase the availability of variable - rate mortgages ; expand the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Veterans Affairs Department </ENAMEX>loan guarantee program ; provide ` adequate ' funding for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Farmers Home Administration </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FmHA </ENAMEX>-RRB- ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low - income and rental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">housing </ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion </NUMEX>in block grants to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>and localities ; and ` fully fund ' the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">McKinney Act </ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 656 million </NUMEX>potpourri for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeless </ENAMEX>. 
2446 Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past , and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well - connected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">lobbyists </ENAMEX>, as demonstrated by the ongoing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD </ENAMEX>scandal , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen </ENAMEX>. 
2689 Indirect subsidies , through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA </ENAMEX>, for instance , are little better . 
2761 Though Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colton </ENAMEX>says expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA </ENAMEX>lending would result in ` no cost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>, ' the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing -LRB- such as low - income -RRB- to the single - family home market would result in a major expense . 
3030 More important , housing programs run by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">VA </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FmHA </ENAMEX>are awash in red ink . 
3114 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA </ENAMEX>alone lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 2 billion </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1988 </TIMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>' s equity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency </ENAMEX>, essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 9 billion </NUMEX>. 
3259 The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>has had to pump in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 28 billion </NUMEX>into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">VA </ENAMEX>housing program since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984 </TIMEX>to keep the fund afloat and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">VA </ENAMEX>requested <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 120 million </NUMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal year </TIMEX>just ended . 
3458 All told , the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>already guarantees <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 900 billion </NUMEX>of mortgages . 
3549 In its nicely produced publication ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Where Will Our Children Live ? </ENAMEX>' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB </ENAMEX>does acknowledge that ` of course , the full measure of housing affordability can not be provided by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>. ' 
3748 It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation , particularly zoning and building fees , which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low - and middle - income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>. 
3939 But while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB </ENAMEX>has suggested actions that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">association </ENAMEX>has proposed no activist legislative program - - comparable to , say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies - - to eliminate counterproductive controls . 
4228 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">association </ENAMEX>, a majority of whose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">156 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">members </ENAMEX>build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 25 </NUMEX>units a year , is like many other business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">lobbies </ENAMEX>. 
4352 Explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheila MacDonald </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Taxpayers Union </ENAMEX>: ` It treads in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>worlds . 
4437 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">builders </ENAMEX>like the subsidies , but at the same time they tend to be fiscal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">conservatives </ENAMEX>in terms of major issues , such as the balanced - budget amendment . ' 
4594 Unfortunately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">organization </ENAMEX>' s desire for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pork </ENAMEX>tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility . 
4711 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago </TIMEX>when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB </ENAMEX>lobbied for the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 billion </NUMEX>omnibus housing bill , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">organization </ENAMEX>` basically dropped out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">coalition </ENAMEX>, ' says Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacDonald </ENAMEX>. 
4879 As Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colton </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB </ENAMEX>acknowledges : ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Government </ENAMEX>is not going to solve the problem . . . . 
4972 The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down . ' 
5042 More money for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD </ENAMEX>will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy ; more money to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">municipalities </ENAMEX>that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies . 
5266 Is this what the home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">builders </ENAMEX>want ?

9 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon M .

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macmillan Inc . </ENAMEX>said it plans a public offering of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 . 4 million </NUMEX>shares of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Berlitz International Inc . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 to $ 21 </NUMEX>a share . 
142 The offering for the language school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>was announced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Maxwell </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell Communication Corp . </ENAMEX>, which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macmillan </ENAMEX>.

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid Corp . </ENAMEX>' s patent - infringement damages case against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastman Kodak Co . </ENAMEX>, one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever , is getting scant attention on Wall Street . 
181 After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">78 days </TIMEX>of mind - numbing testimony in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston </ENAMEX>, the trial is being all but ignored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>and patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys </ENAMEX>. 
318 Most have read the pre - trial documents , however , and estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak </ENAMEX>will be ordered to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion to $ 1 . 5 billion </NUMEX>for infringing on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid </ENAMEX>patents . 
478 That may be the largest patent award ever , but it is well below the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 billion </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid </ENAMEX>seeks . 
576 The highest patent damage award to date was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith International Inc . </ENAMEX>was ordered to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 205 million </NUMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Baker Hughes Inc . </ENAMEX>for infringing on a patent on an oil drilling bit seal . 
768 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>later agreed to settle for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95 million </NUMEX>. 
828 Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>think it is worth their time to slog through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid </ENAMEX>trial testimony . 
916 ` It ' s like panning for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gold </ENAMEX>outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Grand Central Station </ENAMEX>. 
978 You might find something , but the chances are low , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Ellman </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co .  
1091 And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene Glazer </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc . </ENAMEX>, said : ` If you hired an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney </ENAMEX>to be there all the time and give you a -LRB- prediction -RRB- of the eventual award , I would be willing to bet that he would be off ' by a lot . 
1319 A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">75 - day </TIMEX>trial in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s </TIMEX>determined that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak </ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Rochester </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . Y . </ENAMEX>, infringed on patents of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid </ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cambridge </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass .  
1456 The main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was ` willful and deliberate . ' 
1570 If so , the damages could be tripled . 
1609 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>who have read the transcripts , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Nelson </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calvert D . Crary </ENAMEX>, a litigation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Labe , Simpson &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A . David Mazzone </ENAMEX>will decide in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak </ENAMEX>' s favor on the ` willful and deliberate ' issue . 
1863 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crary </ENAMEX>said testimony by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak </ENAMEX>' s patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis T . Carr </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kenyon &amp; Kenyon </ENAMEX>, showed that ` he worked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak </ENAMEX>continuously from the outset of the project ' in an effort to avoid infringement . 
2066 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr </ENAMEX>told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak </ENAMEX>on many occasions to avoid various features because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid </ENAMEX>' s patent positions , ' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak </ENAMEX>followed his advice in every instance , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crary </ENAMEX>said . 
2235 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irving Kayton </ENAMEX>, a patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">George Mason University School of Law </ENAMEX>who is familiar with the case , said the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX>patents were infringed ` suggests that infringement was willful . 
2431 It ' s difficult to be that consistently wrong . ' 
2480 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observers </ENAMEX>also wonder whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mazzone </ENAMEX>will use the lost - profits method of determining damages , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid </ENAMEX>favors because it would result in a larger award , or the reasonable royalty method . 
2680 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid </ENAMEX>claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak </ENAMEX>if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak </ENAMEX>had n't entered the market . 
2815 Moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid </ENAMEX>contends it could have sold them at a higher price - - and thus made higher profits - - because it would n't have been forced to match <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak </ENAMEX>' s lower prices . 
2990 Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">side </ENAMEX>has called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard Business School </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor </ENAMEX>to testify on that issue . 
3073 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak </ENAMEX>hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Buzzell </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid </ENAMEX>brought in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J . Dolan </ENAMEX>. 
3141 ` There ' s nothing that says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard Business school </ENAMEX>have to agree with each other , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buzzell </ENAMEX>. 
3259 Testimony is expected to continue until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early December </TIMEX>. 
3315 A decision is n't expected until some time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>.  

9 While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy ' s prospects , a little - known indicator that has faithfully foreshadowed the economy ' s ups and downs by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity . 
274 The barometer , developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Columbia University </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Center for International Business Cycle Research </ENAMEX>here , reached a record high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">223 . 0 </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest month </TIMEX>available , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers </ENAMEX>estimate that it has moved even higher since then . 
543 The latest reading of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">223 . 0 </NUMEX>was up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">222 . 3 </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">215 . 3 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as recently as March </TIMEX>. 
629 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>rise marked the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth </NUMEX>straight <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly </TIMEX>gain for the indicator , which uses the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1967 </TIMEX>average as a base of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>. 
751 In contrast , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department </ENAMEX>' s widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>, has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early this year </TIMEX>. 
916 Its ragged behavior through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">much of 1989 </TIMEX>has prompted some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forecasters </ENAMEX>to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year ' s end </TIMEX>. 
1059 But the far stronger showing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia </ENAMEX>index ` makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffrey H . Moore </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">facility </ENAMEX>. 
1226 A leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority </ENAMEX>on the business cycle , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore </ENAMEX>also is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Business Cycle Dating Group </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">panel </ENAMEX>of private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists </ENAMEX>that decides for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>when expansions and recessions begin and end . 
1442 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>normally convenes only when a change in the economy ' s general course seems likely . 
1537 ` No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">tracks </ENAMEX>, ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore </ENAMEX>reports . 
1645 Based largely on the recent strength in their index , called the long leading indicator , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>foresee uninterrupted economic growth through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the rest of this year </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>as well . 
1846 They expect a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 . 6 % </NUMEX>rise in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation . 
1943 Underlying this optimism is the index ' s longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department </ENAMEX>' s index of leading indicators . 
2153 Over the full post - <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II </ENAMEX>era , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia </ENAMEX>index , on the average , has entered sustained declines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">14 months </TIMEX>before the onset of recessions and turned up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">eight months </TIMEX>before recoveries . 
2346 The comparable lead times for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce </ENAMEX>index , whose components include the stock market , are far shorter - - <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 months </TIMEX>before recessions and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">only three months </TIMEX>before recoveries . 
2529 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists </ENAMEX>also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved , had it existed , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1929 </TIMEX>, before the stock market crash in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October </TIMEX>that ushered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Great Depression </ENAMEX>. 
2728 The indicator reached a peak in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1929 </TIMEX>and then fell steadily up to and through the crash . 
2825 ` It was an entirely different pattern from what we ' re seeing now , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore </ENAMEX>says . 
2910 A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones </ENAMEX>corporate bond - price index , which is not a part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce </ENAMEX>index . 
3091 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>, the bond measure was at its highest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly </TIMEX>average since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1987 </TIMEX>. 
3172 It also rose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday </TIMEX>, while the stock market sagged . 
3231 Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries , the M2 version of the money supply , adjusted for inflation , and the volume of new home - building permits . 
3460 Notably absent from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia </ENAMEX>index is the stock market , which Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore </ENAMEX>says ` is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy ' s long - range prospects , though it still is useful for anticipating some short - run twists and turns . ' 
3702 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">As recently as 1975 </TIMEX>, the stock market - - as reflected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor ' s </ENAMEX>index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 </NUMEX>common stocks - - was rated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Bureau of Economic Research </ENAMEX>as the best of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 </NUMEX>leading indicators that then made up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce </ENAMEX>index . 
3944 It was assigned a mark of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 </NUMEX>out of a possible <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>, compared with scores ranging <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as low as 69 </NUMEX>for the other components . 
4066 The stock market has lost some precursory power , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">center </ENAMEX>claim , because of the growing impact of international developments . 
4217 ` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore </ENAMEX>says , citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the foreign - trade balance and inflows of foreign capital . 
4442 He also feels that the rise of such computer - based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market ' s relevancy to the economic outlook .  

9 You know what the law of averages is , do n't you ? 
58 It ' s what <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 </NUMEX>-RRB- explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bo Jackson </ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 </NUMEX>-RRB- cautions that it ' s possible to drown in a lake that averages <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">two feet </NUMEX>deep ; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 </NUMEX>-RRB- predicts that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys </ENAMEX>placed before <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 , 000 </NUMEX>pianos would produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 118 </NUMEX>publishable rock ' n ' roll tunes . 
335 <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Baseball </ENAMEX>, that game of the long haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean , and the mean ol ' law caught up with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last weekend </TIMEX>. 
509 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team </ENAMEX>that dumped runs by the bushel on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cubs </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National League </ENAMEX>playoffs was held to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one </NUMEX>in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>games by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">home - team </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Oakland </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A ' s </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">gang </ENAMEX>that had been done unto similarly by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Dodgers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orel Hershiser </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>' s tournament . 
781 Morever , much of the damage was accomplished by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">A ' s </ENAMEX>who had some catching up to do . 
867 In game <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>, on a cool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening </TIMEX>in this land of perpetual <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">autumn </TIMEX>, a lot of the catching up was done by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A ' s </ENAMEX>catcher , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Steinbach </ENAMEX>. 
1010 He hit a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 </NUMEX>- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 </NUMEX>pitch from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Reuschel </ENAMEX>into the left - field <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">stands </ENAMEX>in inning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>to stretch his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team </ENAMEX>' s lead from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 </NUMEX>- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 </NUMEX>to a decisive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 </NUMEX>- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 </NUMEX>, where it stayed . 
1162 So what if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinbach </ENAMEX>had struck just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX>home runs in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130 </NUMEX>regular - season games , and batted in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh </NUMEX>position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A ' s </ENAMEX>lineup . 
1298 ` If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , ' he later remarked . 
1388 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night </TIMEX>, quite a few of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys </ENAMEX>in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and , no doubt , future droughts . 
1529 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark McGwire </ENAMEX>, the big , red - haired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Oakland </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baseman </ENAMEX>, had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>hits in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>at bats , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>more than he ' d had in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>- game <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Dodger </ENAMEX>series in which he ' d gone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 </NUMEX>- for - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 </NUMEX>. 
1701 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">A - men </ENAMEX>batting Nos . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 </NUMEX>through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 </NUMEX>, a . k . a . the ` bottom of the order , ' got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX>of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 </NUMEX>hits and scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>of its runs in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 </NUMEX>- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 </NUMEX>decision . 
1854 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Right - hander </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Stewart </ENAMEX>held the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants </ENAMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>hits to account for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero </NUMEX>on the other side of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday </TIMEX>ledger . 
1975 That he was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A ' s </ENAMEX>winningest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher </ENAMEX>during its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American League </ENAMEX>campaign with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 </NUMEX>- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 </NUMEX>mark , plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>wins over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Toronto </ENAMEX>in the playoffs , indicates he may have <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">some evening </TIMEX>up coming , but with the way his split - fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>. 
2245 The same goes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Moore </ENAMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran </ENAMEX>who overcame early struggles to permit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants </ENAMEX>but a run and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>hits in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX>innings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday </TIMEX>' s contest . 
2405 ` Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy </ENAMEX>they put out there had a better split - finger than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy </ENAMEX>before , ' marveled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giant </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Craig </ENAMEX>. 
2519 He ' s an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex - hurler </ENAMEX>who ' s one of the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gurus </ENAMEX>of the fashionable delivery , which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat . 
2667 The upshot of the downshoot is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A ' s </ENAMEX>go into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Candlestick Park </ENAMEX>tonight up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>games to none in the best - of - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX>fest . 
2808 The stat to reckon with here says that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three </NUMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">clubs </ENAMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 </NUMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 </NUMEX>-RRB- that took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 </NUMEX>- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series </ENAMEX>leads went on to win it all . 
2934 That ' s not an average to soothe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giant </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rooters </ENAMEX>. 
2983 One might think that the home <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans </ENAMEX>in this <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series of the Subway Called BART </ENAMEX>-LRB- that ' s a better name for a public conveyance than ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Desire </ENAMEX>, ' do n't you think ? -RRB- would have been ecstatic over the proceedings , but they observe them in relative calm . 
3225 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Partisans </ENAMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">combatants </ENAMEX>sat side by side in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 , 000 - plus </NUMEX>seats of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Oakland Coliseum </ENAMEX>, and while they cheered their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites </ENAMEX>and booed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opposition </ENAMEX>, hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see . 
3452 A few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks </ENAMEX>even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">teams </ENAMEX>. 
3538 ` I ' m for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants </ENAMEX>today , but only because they lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
3603 I love ' em both . 
3620 The only thing I ' m rooting for is for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series </ENAMEX>to go <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX>games , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Williams </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">septuagenarian </ENAMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Coliseum </ENAMEX>before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday </TIMEX>' s go . 
3777 The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility . 
3838 I choose to believe it ' s the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A ' s </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants </ENAMEX>, is originally from somewhere else . 
4018 Suffice it to say that if this were a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Yankees </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Mets </ENAMEX>series , or one between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cubs </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">White Sox </ENAMEX>-LRB- hey , it ' s possible -RRB- , you ' d need uniformed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police </ENAMEX>in every other seat to separate opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans </ENAMEX>, and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets . 
4284 Anyway , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A ' s </ENAMEX>gave you a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes </ENAMEX>to root for . 
4338 In the opening game , besides <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinbach </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart </ENAMEX>, there was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walt Weiss </ENAMEX>, a twiggy - looking , <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>- year <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shortstop </ENAMEX>who had lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a couple months of the season </TIMEX>to knee surgery . 
4512 He was flawless afield -LRB- ditto in game <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>-RRB- , moved a runner along in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A ' s </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>- run <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>inning , and homered for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team </ENAMEX>' s final tally . 
4653 Such is his reputation among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">East Bay Bashers </ENAMEX>that when he hit his first career home run <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last season </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan </ENAMEX>who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph . 
4845 Not his autograph ; power - hitter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGwire </ENAMEX>' s . 
4890 An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A ' s </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co - hero </ENAMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>game was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rickey Henderson </ENAMEX>, who exemplifies the hot side of the hot - cold equation . 
5001 He smoked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Toronto </ENAMEX>in the playoffs with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six </NUMEX>hits , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX>walks and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight </NUMEX>stolen bases in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 </NUMEX>at bats , and continued that by going <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 </NUMEX>- for - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 </NUMEX>at the plate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday </TIMEX>, along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run . 
5212 ` When you ' re in the groove , you see every ball tremendously , ' he lectured . 
5289 The cold <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys </ENAMEX>in the set were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Clark </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Mitchell </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Williams </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants </ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 </NUMEX>- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 </NUMEX>- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hitters </ENAMEX>. 
5392 They combined for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 </NUMEX>hits , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six </NUMEX>home runs and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 </NUMEX>runs batted in in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>games against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cubs </ENAMEX>. 
5491 They went a collective <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 - </NUMEX>for - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 </NUMEX>here , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero </NUMEX>homers and ribbies . 
5561 It ' s that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants </ENAMEX>hope in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series </ENAMEX>games to come . 
5674 ` I believe in the law of averages , ' declared <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX>batting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dusty Baker </ENAMEX>after game <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>. 
5775 ` I ' d rather see a so - so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hitter </ENAMEX>who ' s hot come up for the other side than a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hitter </ENAMEX>who ' s cold . ' 
5877 But the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Dodger </ENAMEX>slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side . 
5981 ` When it goes , you never know when you ' ll get it back , ' he said . 
6046 ` That ' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">CHICAGO </ENAMEX>- Options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders </ENAMEX>were among the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">victims </ENAMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunging stock market , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>that required an emergency <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million </NUMEX>bailout . 
172 While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>' s rebounding markets helped other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>recoup losses , many options <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>and professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders </ENAMEX>in stock - index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion - dollar </NUMEX>losses , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders </ENAMEX>here and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>said . 
430 Options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders </ENAMEX>were hurt worse than others on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>because of the highly volatile nature of options , which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based . 
681 Thus , options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>. 
826 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Miller </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Miller Tabak Hirsch &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market , it is ` very easy for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys </ENAMEX>to get wiped out . 
987 That may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures . ' 
1062 An options contract gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder </ENAMEX>the right to buy -LRB- call -RRB- or sell -LRB- put -RRB- a specific amount of stock , or in this case the value of a stock index , based on a predetermined price within a given time period . 
1268 Options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders </ENAMEX>who , in return for a small fee , or premium , had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices , which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling . 
1540 They then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices - - in most cases at a substantial loss . 
1667 The latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Board Options Exchange </ENAMEX>, which has never fully recovered from the aftershock of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>fled the market because of huge losses . 
1890 Making matters worse was the fact that late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CBOE </ENAMEX>halted stock - index options trading in step with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange </ENAMEX>' s halt in stock - index futures . 
2071 But while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merc </ENAMEX>reopened <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half hour later </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CBOE </ENAMEX>remained closed , leaving many options <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses . 
2233 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CBOE </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alger ` Duke ' Chapman </ENAMEX>, said that , unlike the futures market , the options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade . 
2406 Exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>reasoned that they would n't have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>, and with the stock - index futures on the verge of closing for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>and final time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CBOE </ENAMEX>reasoned that its best course was to remain closed . 
2683 The damage was so bad at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fossett Corp . </ENAMEX>, an options trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>here , that it was forced to transfer its accounts to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Options of Chicago </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Bank Corp . </ENAMEX>, as a result of options trading losses . 
2899 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fosset </ENAMEX>so far is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">member </ENAMEX>of a financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>to be forced to be taken over by another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>as a result of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s rout . 
3034 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fossett </ENAMEX>still had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several million dollars </NUMEX>in capital left after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s close of trading , but not enough that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>, worried about another potential market plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, would let it reopen for trading , options exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>said . 
3282 Thus , in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CBOE </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Options Clearing Corp . </ENAMEX>, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Fossett </ENAMEX>, put up a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million </NUMEX>to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>in case the market plunged again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
3651 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S . Waite Rawls III </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Bank </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Options </ENAMEX>' parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>took on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 160 </NUMEX>accounts formerly held by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fossett </ENAMEX>, almost all of them belonging to professional floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>. 
3866 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve </ENAMEX>and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>were still worth a lot of money , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rawls </ENAMEX>said . 
3936 ` A package of credit support was put together - - including the assets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve </ENAMEX>and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>. ' 
4032 The bailout was cobbled together over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Reserve Board </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Comptroller of the Currency </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>as well as the options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>. 
4241 ` It was great to have the luxury of time , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rawls </ENAMEX>said . 
4302 At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>point , an options industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>had to talk the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago </ENAMEX>' s night <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchman </ENAMEX>into giving him the home phone number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silas Keene </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Chicago Fed </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>. 
4489 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Options </ENAMEX>did n't have to put any money into the bailout . 
4552 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday </TIMEX>' s rally in the stock , futures and options markets led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CBOE </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amex </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>to conclude that the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million </NUMEX>in guarantees almost certainly wo n't need to be tapped by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Options </ENAMEX>. 
4748 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fossett </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>had some losses and liquidity problems during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>crash as well , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rawls </ENAMEX>said . 
4861 A federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Bank </ENAMEX>worked with securities and banking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>to fashion the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fossett </ENAMEX>bailout , but that conditions were n't dictated by those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies </ENAMEX>. 
5058 ` It was their business decision , ' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>said . 
5113 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Options Clearing Corp . </ENAMEX>, which processes all options trades for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>, said that the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million </NUMEX>guarantee was unprecedented , but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets . 
5331 ` It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Stevens </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">OCC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief operating officer </ENAMEX>. 
5464 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens </ENAMEX>declined to give the specific contributions to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million </NUMEX>guarantee from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">participant </ENAMEX>. 
5572 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CBOE </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amex </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Options Clearing Corp . </ENAMEX>contributed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million </NUMEX>to the guarantee , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CBOE </ENAMEX>put up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million </NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amex </ENAMEX>added <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 million </NUMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18 million </NUMEX>came from Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fossett </ENAMEX>' s own assets . 
5783 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fossett </ENAMEX>could n't be reached to comment .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MLX Corp . </ENAMEX>said it reached a preliminary agreement with senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders </ENAMEX>to its refrigeration and air - conditioning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>to restructure the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 188 . 5 million </NUMEX>of credit facilities the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders </ENAMEX>provide to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>. 
218 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MLX </ENAMEX>, which also makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft </ENAMEX>and heavy - duty truck parts , said the debt was accumulated during its acquisition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses </ENAMEX>that make up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>, the biggest portion of which was related to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>purchase of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hillman Co . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>. 
460 Among other things , the restructured <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities </ENAMEX>will substantially reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>' s required amortization of the term loan portion of the credit facilities through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1992 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MLX </ENAMEX>said . 
652 Certain details of the restructured <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities </ENAMEX>remain to be negotiated . 
724 The agreement is subject to completion of a definitive amendment and appropriate approvals . 
818 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William P . Panny </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MLX </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>, said the pact ` will provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MLX </ENAMEX>with the additional time and flexibility necessary to complete the restructuring of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s capital structure . ' 
1022 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MLX </ENAMEX>has filed a registration statement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission </ENAMEX>covering a proposed offering of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 120 million </NUMEX>in long - term senior subordinated notes and warrants .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David D . Lung </ENAMEX>was appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief operating officer </ENAMEX>of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of building materials for manufactured <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes </ENAMEX>and recreational <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles </ENAMEX>. 
161 As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lung </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">42 years old </TIMEX>, succeeds his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mervin D .

9 Should you really own stocks ? 
41 That ' s a question a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>are asking , following the stock market ' s stunning display of volatility . 
148 Whipsawed financially and emotionally by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s heartstopping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 </NUMEX>- point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88 </NUMEX>- point rebound , they ' re wondering if an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual </ENAMEX>has any business being in the market . 
372 The answer , say academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers </ENAMEX>, money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>and investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>, is yes - - as long as you approach the stock market as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX>. 
520 But , they say , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>should n't try to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>, who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock . 
666 The case for owning stocks over the long - term is compelling . 
729 ` If you look at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">75 years </TIMEX>worth of investment history - - including the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Great Depression </ENAMEX>and every bear market since - - stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Berlin </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Wachovia Capital Management </ENAMEX>. 
1012 A dollar invested in the stock market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1926 </TIMEX>would have grown to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 473 . 29 </NUMEX>by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of last June </TIMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Siegel </ENAMEX>, managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ibbotson Associates Inc .  
1187 But a dollar invested in long - term bonds in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1926 </TIMEX>would have grown to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 16 . 56 </NUMEX>, and a dollar put in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bills would equal <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a meager $ 9 . 29 </NUMEX>. 
1334 The longer the time period , the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market . 
1422 Over time , the odds increasingly favor the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX>with a diversified portfolio . 
1504 For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Gregory </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX>money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>, calculates that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor ' s </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 </NUMEX>- stock index , the chance of losing money is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 % to 4 % </NUMEX>over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 - year </TIMEX>period , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % </NUMEX>over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years </TIMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % </NUMEX>over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one year </TIMEX>. 
1791 ` If you do n't need the money for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years </TIMEX>, there ' s a clear - cut case for sticking to a steady core of stocks , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory </ENAMEX>says . 
1921 Stock - market investments also help balance the other assets an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual </ENAMEX>owns , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Blankenship Jr . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Institute of Certified Financial Planners </ENAMEX>. 
2088 Stocks have a place in an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>' portfolio along with real estate , bonds , international securities and cash , he says . 
2212 There are some important caveats : Before investing in stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals </ENAMEX>should have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least three to six months </TIMEX>of living expenses set aside in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>, most investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers </ENAMEX>say . 
2399 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals </ENAMEX>also should focus on building equity in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home </ENAMEX>, which provides some protection against inflation , as well as a nest - egg that can be cashed in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living . 
2613 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>also should n't invest money in stocks that they ' ll need in the near future - - for example , for college tuition payments or retirement expenses . 
2764 ` You may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blankenship </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Del Mar </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner </ENAMEX>. 
2902 But once the basics are covered , ` then I would start to invest , even if it ' s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as $ 1 , 000 </NUMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Lipper </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lipper Analytical Services Inc .  
3067 He says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals </ENAMEX>should consider not just stocks , but other long - term investments , such as high - quality bonds . 
3183 Despite the strong case for stocks , however , most pros warn that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals </ENAMEX>should n't try to profit from short - term developments . 
3314 ` It ' s very difficult to do , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Holt </ENAMEX>, a market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wedbush Morgan Securities </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX>brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>. 
3442 ` Our markets move so fast and they are so volatile , there ' s no way the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX>can compete with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros </ENAMEX>. ' 
3560 Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market . 
3645 The cost of executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order , but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 % </NUMEX>of the order ' s value is an average , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Boesel </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T . Rowe Price </ENAMEX>' s Growth and Income mutual fund . 
3871 And assuming their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>investment is successful , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>will have to pay taxes on their gains . 
3971 That can reduce returns by a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX>or more , once local taxes are included , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipper </ENAMEX>says . 
4063 After that , individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't perform well - - so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing . 
4223 ` It ' s very tough for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals </ENAMEX>to out - trade the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">mutual funds </ENAMEX>or the market , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipper </ENAMEX>. 
4324 ` You should really think twice if you think you can out - smart the system . ' 
4401 Then , too , many individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>lack the sturdy emotional makeup <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals </ENAMEX>say is needed to plunge in and out of the market . 
4537 So what ' s the best way to buy stocks ? 
4575 ` Unless an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual </ENAMEX>has a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 50 , 000 and $ 100 , 000 </NUMEX>to invest in stocks , he ' s still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks , in terms of getting enough attention from a competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker </ENAMEX>, ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipper </ENAMEX>. 
4811 Still , he adds , ` I could see owning both , given that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals </ENAMEX>often have an advantage over big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>in spotting special situations based on their own insights , ' he adds . 
4991 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Douglas </ENAMEX>, first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . </ENAMEX>, says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals </ENAMEX>have a particular edge now in ` small to medium - size niche <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>with exciting earnings prospects ' - - a traditional stomping ground for small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>. 
5238 This growth sector , which usually carries a price \/ earnings multiple about twice that of the Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 , happens to include some of the market ' s most attractive bargains right now . 
5429 ` It ' s now selling at a multiple about even with the market , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas </ENAMEX>. 
5510 Moreover , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas </ENAMEX>sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term . 
5667 Many big Wall Street brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few years ago </TIMEX>are now resuming coverage of this area , he notes . 
5846 ` We ' re seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks , ' he says . 
5926 The pros strenuously advise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals </ENAMEX>to stay away from the latest investment fad . 
6011 They say that ' s especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle , when there ' s no robust bull market to bail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>out of their mistakes . 
6179 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s correction presents ` a pretty good buying opportunity , but let ' s not speculate at this point in the business cycle , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmine Grigoli </ENAMEX>, chief equity portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp .  
6383 ` Buy stocks on weakness for their long - term fundamentals , ' he says . 
6453 In the long run , investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers </ENAMEX>say , most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>will be better off using the dollar - cost averaging method of buying stocks . 
6586 In this method , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person </ENAMEX>invests a regular amount <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every month </TIMEX>or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">quarter </TIMEX>into the stock market whether the market is up or down . 
6715 That cuts the risk , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX>money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>, points out . 
6795 ` When the market is low , you are buying more shares , and when it ' s high , you ' re buying fewer shares , ' he says . 
6906 Otherwise , if you put all your money in at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>time , by sheer bad luck , you might pick a terrible time , and have to wait <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years </TIMEX>to get even , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory </ENAMEX>says . 
7072 A disciplined program will work the best , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesel </ENAMEX>says . 
7131 ` One of the hardest things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down , ' he says . 
7216 ` But that ' s just the time when you should be buying them . '

537 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN </ENAMEX>is asking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw </ENAMEX>to clarify its tender offer , which challenges an agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth Corp . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN </ENAMEX>to merge their cellular - telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses </ENAMEX>.

159 SOFT CONTACT LENSES WON federal blessing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 18 , 1971 </TIMEX>, and quickly became eye openers for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>. 
270 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Food and Drug Administration </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day </TIMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bausch &amp; Lomb </ENAMEX>could start selling them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
368 The cornflake - size product was more comfortable and less prone to falling out than hard contact lenses , which had been around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">since 1939 </TIMEX>. 
506 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bausch &amp; Lomb </ENAMEX>sold the softies under a sublicense from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Patent Development </ENAMEX>, which had gained the rights from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Czechoslovakia Academy of Sciences </ENAMEX>. 
663 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto Wichterle </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Czech </ENAMEX>, invented them in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1962 </TIMEX>. 
713 The plastic lens wraps itself over the cornea , absorbing eye moisture while permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oxygen </ENAMEX>to pass through . 
826 But the new lens became the eye of a storm . 
870 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1971 </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>seized ` bootlegged ' lenses - - made by unlicensed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>- - after some showed traces of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bacteria </ENAMEX>. 
1009 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors </ENAMEX>were debating the product ' s safety , some claiming it caused infections . 
1100 And there were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>hearings on the questions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1972 </TIMEX>. 
1162 The product overcame the bad publicity and kept evolving . 
1222 The early soft lenses , which cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 </NUMEX>a set , were expected to last for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year </TIMEX>.

159 CREATIVE ACCOUNTING , mostly by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerates </ENAMEX>, forced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CPAs </ENAMEX>to change their way of setting standards to be followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>reporting financial results , standards that had become all too flexible . 
364 The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Financial Accounting Standards Board </ENAMEX>-LRB- FASB -RRB- was created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972 </TIMEX>to replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Accounting Principles Board </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Institute of Certified Public Accountants </ENAMEX>. 
538 All of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">board </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CPAs </ENAMEX>, provoking conflict - of - interest criticism because they were writing rules while handling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>' books at the same time . 
706 The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">board </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX>- member structure kept <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CPAs </ENAMEX>, but the others were from industry and academia . 
811 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis M .

978 The former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">board </ENAMEX>had produced ` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 </NUMEX>opinions and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics </ENAMEX>' in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12 - year </TIMEX>life , its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>had conceded . 
1090 The climate was right for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">FASB </ENAMEX>. 
1130 In the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960s </TIMEX>some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CPAs </ENAMEX>failed to correct such abuses as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>picking permissive rules that hyped earnings and stock prices . 
1262 And in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November 1970 </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>had passed a special act to overrule <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>board rule . 
1345 Also , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Needham </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner </ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1972 </TIMEX>had warned that the industry might face a ` federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency </ENAMEX>writing accounting rules ' if they rejected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">FASB </ENAMEX>idea . 
1517 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Keepers </ENAMEX>of the books , dubbed ` figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filberts </ENAMEX>, ' loathed the threat . 
1587 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">FASB </ENAMEX>had its initial meeting on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 28 , 1973 </TIMEX>. 
1639 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec . 13 , 1973 </TIMEX>, it issued its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>rule ; it required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>to disclose foreign currency translations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>dollars . 
1764 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">FASB </ENAMEX>since then has issued <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 </NUMEX>rules , and some still rile industry . 
1836 Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1987 </TIMEX>, for example , it has put off a rule dealing with deferred income taxes because of the continuing controversy over the issue .

9 First , there was a death watch . 
41 Then exhilaration . 
62 Spurred by waves of large - scale buying in blue - chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>and erased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a half </NUMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 . 58 </NUMEX>- point plunge , gaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88 . 12 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2657 . 38 </NUMEX>. 
256 It was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth </NUMEX>- biggest advance for the average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 </NUMEX>blue chips , on frenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">416 , 290 , 000 </NUMEX>shares - - the highest since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the days </TIMEX>after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash . 
443 While the advance cheered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>who feared a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>- style crash would occur <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, it was strictly a big - stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain - hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>and program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>. 
638 A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>outnumbered advancers , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">975 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">749 </NUMEX>, and the over - the - counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>plunge . 
847 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq </ENAMEX>OTC index closed down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 . 31 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">460 . 98 </NUMEX>. 
898 Meanwhile , in a divergence in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>of the market ' s most important indicators , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>industrials ' sister average , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 </NUMEX>- stock Dow Jones Transportation Average , tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 . 06 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1304 . 23 </NUMEX>- - its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>- worst decline next to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">164 . 78 </NUMEX>- point fall during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash . 
1168 Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>airline stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>, which each fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 % </NUMEX>when they reopened for trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>after being suspended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>. 
1362 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>, the takeover stock at the center of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 . 58 </NUMEX>- point market plunge , fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 7 \/ 8 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">222 7 \/ 8 </NUMEX>on nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 . 3 million </NUMEX>shares . 
1495 Overall , ` this is a pleasant rally but it ' s very selective , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Cashin Jr . </ENAMEX>, a veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>. 
1632 ` Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory . 
1765 It ' s just a strange feeling . 
1794 I do n't think anyone left the place whistling <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Dixie </ENAMEX>. ' 
1850 The rally gave credence , at least for now , to the pre - trading declaration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J . Phelan Jr . </ENAMEX>that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s market debacle was ` an abnormal condition , and not a disaster . ' 
2045 But to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>, it looked like disaster on the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 : 30 a . m . </TIMEX>opening bell . 
2118 The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 . 64 </NUMEX>shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 : 30 </TIMEX>. 
2188 But most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 </NUMEX>blue - chip stocks in the average , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastman Kodak </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors </ENAMEX>, could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late - afternoon </TIMEX>rout . 
2388 At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 : 45 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Procter &amp; Gamble </ENAMEX>- - one of the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bellwethers </ENAMEX>of late - - opened down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117 </NUMEX>. 
2498 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>dropped to a quick <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 </NUMEX>- point loss , and to many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble . 
2625 More stocks opened over the ensuing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half hour </TIMEX>, as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>to match the selling flood . 
2832 Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steeper losses . 
2937 There was heavy stock - index arbitrage , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>sold big baskets of stock and bought stock - index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>markets . 
3108 This was a hangover from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor ' s </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 </NUMEX>- stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks . 
3230 The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>would hold off until the market stabilized . 
3371 They did n't . 
3384 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>accelerated its slide , losing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 . 52 </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 40 minutes </TIMEX>of trading . 
3466 With program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>seemingly in charge , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>backed away from the market and watched stocks fall . 
3570 Then at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 : 15 </TIMEX>the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early - morning </TIMEX>fall . 
3696 And this time , it was n't just the program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>who were responsible . 
3768 All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>and major money management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>started buying stocks heavily . 
3913 The program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>were in there , too , of course . 
3964 But according to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">programmers </ENAMEX>` did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was -LCB- also -RCB- a lot of bargain - hunting ' by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>. 
4137 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roland M . Machold </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Jersey Division of Investment </ENAMEX>, which oversees <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 29 billion </NUMEX>in investments , said the ` first thing we did was to double our orders ' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning </TIMEX>. 
4324 ` With the market down like this , we ' ll probably take another <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million </NUMEX>and put it in ' the market . 
4426 Trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Walt Disney Co . </ENAMEX>particularly caught <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>' eyes . 
4488 According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Disney </ENAMEX>had one of the biggest sell - order imbalances on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>; it was one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX>stocks that could n't finish trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day </TIMEX>. 
4655 The stock opened late at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>. 
4701 But then it shot upward <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>stepped in and bought , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>said . 
4792 However , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Disney </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Fagenson </ENAMEX>said : ` I would be surprised if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman </ENAMEX>represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 % </NUMEX>of the opening volume . ' 
4915 Around Wall Street , trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, in contrast to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s gridlock . 
5049 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc . </ENAMEX>, head equity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dudley Eppel </ENAMEX>said : ` I think the opening was constructive . 
5164 It was orderly . 
5180 We put some orders together . 
5209 There was n't a lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally . . . 
5290 . Not like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>where they just took -LCB- the market -RCB- apart . ' 
5351 Still , the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>were glum . 
5436 But in another dramatic burst , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>tacked on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 </NUMEX>points in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes </TIMEX>, and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 : 25 </TIMEX>the index showed a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 . 74 </NUMEX>. 
5560 On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>floor and on trading desks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>yelped their approval . 
5636 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grinned Griffith Peck </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </ENAMEX>' s OTC <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department </ENAMEX>: ` I tell you , this market acts healthy . ' 
5758 Around him , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>seemed to get a burst of energy ; their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss </ENAMEX>broke out bottles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Perrier </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water </ENAMEX>to cool them off . 
5887 Among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>, the cry was ` Pull your offers ' - - meaning that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>soon expected to get higher prices for their shares . 
6030 ` It was bedlam on the upside , ' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist </ENAMEX>. 
6094 But not everybody was making money . 
6130 The carnage on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Board Options Exchange </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s major options market , was heavy after the trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>stock - index options was halted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
6294 Many market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>index options contract had bullish positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses . 
6443 Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>, clearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>told the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>to get out of their positions at any cost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning </TIMEX>. 
6567 ` They were absolutely killed , slaughtered , ' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>- based options <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>. 
6652 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>said that the closely watched Major Market Index , whose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 </NUMEX>stocks mimic the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>industrials , did n't lead <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s big rally . 
6795 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Gallagher </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>at specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fowler &amp; Rosenau </ENAMEX>, said , ` The difference between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>' - - ` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Terrible Tuesday </ENAMEX>, ' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 20 , 1987 </TIMEX>- - ` is that then we needed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savior </ENAMEX>to go into the Major Market Index , spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 million </NUMEX>and get the program rally started . 
7069 This time -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>-RCB- saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away . 
7151 Then when the market was at a technical level to buy , they came in with a vengeance . ' 
7239 However , according to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>, the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Terrible Tuesday </ENAMEX>. 
7390 ` Futures were pulling the stock market higher , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Selkin </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of stock - index futures research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential - Bache Securities Inc .  
7533 Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>' s specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>struggled through another highly volatile trading session , their performance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>was better than during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late - afternoon </TIMEX>chaos , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers </ENAMEX>who work with them . 
7771 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Specialists </ENAMEX>were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>plunge . 
7873 But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, even with halts in such major blue - chip stocks as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merck </ENAMEX>, ` we expected -LRB- the halts -RRB- and it was n't too bad , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson </ENAMEX>' s Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eppel </ENAMEX>, who had been critical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>' performance on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
8087 According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>, while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading halts in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three </NUMEX>issues - - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merck </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valero Energy </ENAMEX>. 
8243 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merck </ENAMEX>is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index . 
8314 No sector of the market has been spared during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two days </TIMEX>' gyrations . 
8391 Yet from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>industrials ' high on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 9 </TIMEX>through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge , relatively good performances have been turned in by real - estate , utilities , precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals </ENAMEX>and life insurance stocks . 
8580 And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues . 
8661 For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Halliburton </ENAMEX>jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 </NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schlumberger </ENAMEX>rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Baker Hughes </ENAMEX>rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1 \/ 8 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 </NUMEX>. 
8777 Because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>tumbles , airlines were the weakest sector of the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
8873 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris </ENAMEX>was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>' s most active issue , rising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>on nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight million </NUMEX>shares . 
8983 Among other major issues , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca - Cola Co . </ENAMEX>closed up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 </NUMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66 3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 . 7 million </NUMEX>shares and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone &amp; Telegraph </ENAMEX>rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 </NUMEX>on nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 . 8 million </NUMEX>shares . 
9149 Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines </ENAMEX>, which reported earnings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, finished at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103 </NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 </NUMEX>, after slipping below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s session for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years </TIMEX>. 
9335 Shares of three brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>rose after they reported earnings . 
9402 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch </ENAMEX>added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 </NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber </ENAMEX>rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns </ENAMEX>rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 \/ 8 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>. 
9505 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal National Mortgage Association </ENAMEX>, a recently hot stock , climbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124 </NUMEX>on nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 . 6 million </NUMEX>shares . 
9615 At a news conference after the close of trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>' s Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan </ENAMEX>and other exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>praised the performance of their computers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel </ENAMEX>. 
9790 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan </ENAMEX>said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s decline despite a jump in the use of the computer - driven strategies in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">recent months </TIMEX>. 
9968 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 24 million </NUMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100 million </NUMEX>shares traded in the final <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes </TIMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s session , when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated , were program - related , he said . 
10155 Program trades make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>' s volume on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">an average day </TIMEX>, but despite the increase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, it was ` certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan </ENAMEX>said . 
10358 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan </ENAMEX>expressed relief that the market rebounded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
10423 ` Obviously , every time we get this kind of reaction , it ' s going to make everybody nervous , including me , ' he said . 
10538 He said that exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>had conversations with Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>and that ` all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants </ENAMEX>behaved very , very responsibly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. ' 
10706 Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter DaPuzzo </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of retail equity trading , praised institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>in the OTC market , who were heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq </ENAMEX>' s biggest technology issues <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>amid a flood of selling by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>. 
10943 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>ca n't be criticized for their behavior , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DaPuzzo </ENAMEX>said in an interview . 
11036 ` It was the opposite of what happened on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 19 </TIMEX>. 
11086 They used their judgment . 
11112 They did n't panic during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>round of selling <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning </TIMEX>. 
11178 Instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which kept the market orderly . 
11270 Maybe they learned from experience . ' 
11309 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan </ENAMEX>said the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge was admirable , because out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 640 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>common stocks traded during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day </TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven </NUMEX>were closed and were n't reopened before the close . 
11523 ` They did an excellent job , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan </ENAMEX>said of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>.

188 Integrated did n't identify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">party </ENAMEX>or say why the talks failed . 
254 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week </TIMEX>another potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Whitehall Financial Group </ENAMEX>- - which had agreed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>to purchase most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated </ENAMEX>' s core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 310 million </NUMEX>- - ended talks with Integrated . 
444 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated </ENAMEX>said that it would continue to pursue ` other alternatives ' to sell the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>and that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group </ENAMEX>of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>plans to make a proposal to purchase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>- - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated Resources Equity Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resources Trust Co . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated Resources Asset Management Corp .

897 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>did n't disclose the new estimate but said the change was related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated </ENAMEX>' s failure to sell its core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses </ENAMEX>, as well as ` other events , ' which it did n't detail , that occurred after its announcement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>that it was in talks with the unidentified prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer </ENAMEX>.

1645 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Whitehall </ENAMEX>cited concerns about how long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated </ENAMEX>would be able to hold together the sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force </ENAMEX>as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>reason its talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated </ENAMEX>failed .

977 He did n't elaborate on other asset sales being considered . 
1038 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farley </ENAMEX>followed a similar pattern when he acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northwest Industries Inc . </ENAMEX>and then sold much of its assets . 
1153 But he kept <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fruit of the Loom Inc . </ENAMEX>, the underwear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>that he still controls and serves as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>. 
1278 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cluett </ENAMEX>was an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">West Point - Pepperell </ENAMEX>acquired it for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 375 million </NUMEX>in cash and stock in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>.

52 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">JAPANESE </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">luxury - car </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>are trying to set strict design standards for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealerships </ENAMEX>. 
144 But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>are negotiating looser terms , while others decline to deal at all . 
230 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan Motor Co . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division </ENAMEX>likes to insist that every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer </ENAMEX>construct and furnish a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building </ENAMEX>in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>style . 
356 Specifications include a polished bronze sculpture at the center of each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">showroom </ENAMEX>and a tile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridge </ENAMEX>spanning a stream that flows into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building </ENAMEX>from outside . 
519 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti </ENAMEX>has it down to the ashtrays , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Ferron </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J . D . Power &amp; Associates </ENAMEX>, an auto research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>. 
639 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota Motor Corp . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division </ENAMEX>also provides specifications . 
706 But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two - thirds </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>are constructing new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings </ENAMEX>according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus </ENAMEX>specs . 
804 Some are even coming up with their own novel designs . 
858 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Louisville </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ky . </ENAMEX>, for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Peterson </ENAMEX>has built a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealership </ENAMEX>with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">showroom </ENAMEX>on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>floor . 
976 Yet some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>have turned down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchises </ENAMEX>because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements . 
1110 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Seidman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland </ENAMEX>says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti </ENAMEX>` was a bear on interiors ' but at least let him retrofit an existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building </ENAMEX>- - without the stream . 
1249 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seidman </ENAMEX>says he turned down a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchise </ENAMEX>in part because ` the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building </ENAMEX>was gorgeous but very expensive . ' 
1365 To head off arguments , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti </ENAMEX>offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>cash bonuses and low - interest construction loans . 
1464 Dictation Device ' s Saga Plays Back a Lesson 
1512 PRODUCTS DO N'T have to be <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>to be winners . 
1559 That ' s the lesson offered through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>case study featured in a design exhibit . 
1640 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone Corp . </ENAMEX>was caught off guard in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974 </TIMEX>when its main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lanier Office Products of Japan </ENAMEX>, introduced a microcassette dictation recorder <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>the size of standard cassette devices . 
1835 Blocked by patent protection from following suit , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone </ENAMEX>decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>again - - down to the length of a paperclip . 
1998 By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pitney Bowes </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>, had produced a working model of a ` picocassette ' recorder . 
2134 By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982 </TIMEX>, however , the patent status of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lanier </ENAMEX>microcassette had changed , permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone </ENAMEX>to develop its own competitive micro system , which it did . 
2292 Marketing and sales <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">departments </ENAMEX>then urged abandonment of the pico project . 
2368 But others said pico should proceed . 
2405 Both were right . 
2424 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone </ENAMEX>went ahead and introduced the pico in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985 </TIMEX>, but it has n't sold well . 
2504 To date , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emil Jachmann </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, it has ` broken even or shown a small loss . ' 
2608 Nevertheless , the device has been successful in other ways . 
2668 It helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone </ENAMEX>attract better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers </ENAMEX>, and it provided new technology for other company products . 
2774 The picocassette recorder also helped transform the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s reputation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">follower </ENAMEX>to leading - edge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">innovator </ENAMEX>. 
2890 ` It gave me great pride to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor </ENAMEX>of the microcassette in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>look at the pico and shake his head and say ` unbelievable , ' ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jachmann </ENAMEX>. 
3047 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone </ENAMEX>' s picocassette recorder is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 </NUMEX>case studies in the TRIAD Design Project , sponsored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Design Management Institute of Boston </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard Business School </ENAMEX>. 
3221 The studies are on exhibit at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month </TIMEX>and will travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Institute of Design </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of California at Berkeley </ENAMEX>. 
3367 A Rake ' s Progress Means Branching Out 
3409 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ONE </NUMEX>DAY <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Barrett </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mobile </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ala . </ENAMEX>, was raking some sycamore <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves </ENAMEX>, but the rake kept riding up over the piles . 
3524 The harder he tried to push them into large piles , the closer he came to breaking the rake and straining his back . 
3641 So Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrett </ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alabama Steamship Association </ENAMEX>, took a steel - toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">about nine inches </NUMEX>up . 
3815 His crude device worked : The lower teeth gathered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves </ENAMEX>into a pile , while the higher , harder teeth moved the top of the pile . 
3947 Now incorporated into a polypropylene rake , the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">four - inch </NUMEX>prongs , or ` wonderbars , ' also are supposed to aid in picking up <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves </ENAMEX>. 
4079 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Blaggs </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mobile </ENAMEX>, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Barrett Rake </ENAMEX>allowed him to do his lawn in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">2 1 \/ 2 hours </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours </TIMEX>less than usual . 
4212 But other rake <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>have their doubts . 
4253 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Mason </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ames Co . </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Parkersburg </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">W . Va . </ENAMEX>, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrett </ENAMEX>rake ` makes sense , ' but it would be ` tough ' to explain to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>. 
4402 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Stoner </ENAMEX>, marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">True Temper Corp . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Black &amp; Decker </ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>do n't want to move a leaf pile . 
4533 ` They either pick it up , ' he says , ` or they start pulling from a fresh direction . ' 
4618 Odds and Ends 
4632 NO MORE STUBBED toes or bruised shins , promises <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Geste Corp . </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Goshen </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ind . </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">designer </ENAMEX>of a bed support to replace traditional frames . 
4770 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four </NUMEX>tubular steel ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Bedfellows </ENAMEX>, ' each roughly in the shape of a ` W , ' are attached to the bottom of the box spring in a recessed position . . . . 
4914 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly half </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>say they ' ll pay <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 5 % </NUMEX>more for packaging that can be recycled or is biodegradable , according to a survey commissioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Michael Peters Group </ENAMEX>, a design <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consultant </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Korean </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car </ENAMEX>exports have slid <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 % </NUMEX>so far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>here are n't panicking . 
107 They are enjoying domestic sales that are more than making up for lost overseas sales . 
194 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South Korean </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>are expected to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 500 , 000 </NUMEX>passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>. 
296 In fact , some auto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>suggest that slackened demand for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>is a blessing ; otherwise they would n't be able to keep up with demand in the more profitable local market . 
503 ` We are very lucky to easily change an export loss to domestic plus , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Tu Pyo </ENAMEX>, managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of domestic marketing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hyundai Motor Co .  
655 As it is , waiting lists of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a month </TIMEX>are n't unusual for popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models </ENAMEX>. 
725 Demand is so strong that all of the domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>- - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hyundai </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kia Motors Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daewoo Motor Co . </ENAMEX>and even upstart <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SsangYong Motor Co . </ENAMEX>- - plan to build more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories </ENAMEX>. 
894 Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>predict that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1995 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea </ENAMEX>will be building <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three million </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars </ENAMEX>a year - - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half </NUMEX>of that for export . 
1025 It ' s an optimistic move in a industry already facing world - wide overcapacity . 
1103 But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South Korean </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>are confident that the export market will bounce back and that demand in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Korea </ENAMEX>will stay strong . 
1229 Currently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one </NUMEX>in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South Koreans </ENAMEX>owns a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car </ENAMEX>, up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a decade ago </TIMEX>. 
1313 ` In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year 2000 </TIMEX>it will be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car </ENAMEX>per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family </ENAMEX>. 
1362 At that point domestic sales will slow down , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim Yoon Kwon </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of marketing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daewoo Motor </ENAMEX>. 
1470 The reason for the tremendous demand is simple : <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South Koreans </ENAMEX>suddenly have a lot more money . 
1564 ` We never thought we ' d own a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car </ENAMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kwang Ok Kyong </ENAMEX>, who just bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daewoo </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">LeMans </ENAMEX>on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five - year </TIMEX>loan . 
1673 She and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband </ENAMEX>started a small printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business </ENAMEX>and need the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car </ENAMEX>for work as well as for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">weekend </TIMEX>jaunts . 
1786 Pay raises of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 % </NUMEX>over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past three years </TIMEX>have given many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South Koreans </ENAMEX>the money to enjoy the things they were supplying the rest of the world . 
1933 The success of newcomer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SsangYong Motor </ENAMEX>shows the strength of the auto market and its growing diversity . 
2038 A part of the construction - oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SsangYong Group </ENAMEX>, it took over the dying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dong - A Motor Co . </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>. 
2153 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SsangYong </ENAMEX>began making variations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jeep </ENAMEX>- like ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Korando </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle </ENAMEX>. 
2223 -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dong - A </ENAMEX>had had a technology agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jeep </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Motors Corp . </ENAMEX>, now a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler Corp . </ENAMEX>-RRB- 
2331 The most popular style is the stretched ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Family </ENAMEX>, ' which resembles a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Bronco </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevy </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Blazer </ENAMEX>. 
2428 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>- wheel - drive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles </ENAMEX>start at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 , 000 </NUMEX>; a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Family </ENAMEX>can cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $ 25 , 000 </NUMEX>. 
2510 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SsangYong </ENAMEX>, which has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 3 % </NUMEX>of the domestic market , will sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 18 , 000 </NUMEX>of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, twice as many as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>. 
2645 It sees sales rising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>. 
2699 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>plans to expand plant capacity <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX>by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991 </TIMEX>. 
2755 By then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car </ENAMEX>based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Volvo </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">240 </ENAMEX>and selling for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 20 , 000 </NUMEX>. 
2868 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hyundai </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daewoo </ENAMEX>seem unconcerned about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SsangYong </ENAMEX>threat , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kia </ENAMEX>, the scrappy No . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>, is selling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>- wheel - drive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles </ENAMEX>through its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>. 
3030 It plans to sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 700 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>. 
3070 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kia </ENAMEX>, the only <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Korean </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>that has seen its overseas sales grow in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>, aims at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Korea </ENAMEX>' s common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>. 
3176 Its advantage has been the peppy little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Pride </ENAMEX>, sold as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Festiva </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
3260 At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 . 8 million won </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 , 700 </NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">econobox </ENAMEX>is the lowest - priced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea </ENAMEX>. 
3345 Along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>claims <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 % </NUMEX>of the domestic market . 
3422 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor Co . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mazda Motor Corp . </ENAMEX>have equity interests in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kia </ENAMEX>. 
3499 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kia </ENAMEX>is the most aggressive of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Korean </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Big Three </ENAMEX>in offering financing . 
3573 Loans for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">as long as five years </TIMEX>make the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars </ENAMEX>very accessible , with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly </TIMEX>payments <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as low as 80 , 000 won </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 120 </NUMEX>. 
3691 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daewoo Motor </ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 - 50 </NUMEX>joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp . </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daewoo Group </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate </ENAMEX>, is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>that appears to be hurting . 
3839 Shipments of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Lemans </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pontiac </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division </ENAMEX>are off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 65 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago </TIMEX>, versus a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 % </NUMEX>decline for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hyundai </ENAMEX>and an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 % </NUMEX>increase for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kia </ENAMEX>. 
3985 Moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daewoo </ENAMEX>' s domestic sales have grown <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>as fast as sales of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals </ENAMEX>. 
4069 The big problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daewoo </ENAMEX>, which holds <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 21 % </NUMEX>of the market , is the long series of labor disruptions it suffered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
4197 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daewoo </ENAMEX>is expanding too . 
4226 In fact , a sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery </ENAMEX>, plans to build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">minicars </ENAMEX>by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid - 1990s </TIMEX>. 
4346 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hyundai </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Korean </ENAMEX>market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">leader </ENAMEX>with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58 % </NUMEX>share , also plans to jump into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">minicars </ENAMEX>at the same time . 
4449 It has a similar project for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars </ENAMEX>a year . 
4499 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kia </ENAMEX>is reportedly also considering such a plan . 
4547 Even giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Samsung Group </ENAMEX>is rumored in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Korean </ENAMEX>press to be considering getting into the auto - making business ; a company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>had no comment .  

9 What happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another meltdown in prices . 
134 No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling . 
240 But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency . 
301 After the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>plunge , markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose . 
410 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>adopted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>specific circuit breakers : If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones </ENAMEX>index falls <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250 </NUMEX>points in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a day </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>will halt trading for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour </TIMEX>; if the decline hits <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400 </NUMEX>points , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>will close for an additional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours </TIMEX>. 
657 The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>to reconsider their strategies , calm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers </ENAMEX>and lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>to enter the market at indicated new price levels . 
841 It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic . 
900 A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself . 
995 But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices . 
1126 What happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>was the worst of all worlds . 
1176 The futures exchanges followed their own pre - set circuit breakers and shut down at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 3 p . m . </TIMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes </TIMEX>, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor ' s </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 </NUMEX>stock index had fallen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 </NUMEX>points , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100 </NUMEX>points on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones </ENAMEX>index . 
1398 Options markets stopped trading in many securities . 
1450 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>, under its own rules , remained open . 
1517 With nowhere else to go , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers </ENAMEX>, and particularly program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>, focused all their selling on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>. 
1643 As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply . 
1704 Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense . 
1859 At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 : 30 </TIMEX>, after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>, the futures exchanges reopened . 
1981 Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 : 45 </TIMEX>, after the futures markets had dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 30 </NUMEX>points , which is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX>limit for price declines . 
2146 At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>. 
2273 It is time to recognize that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>, the futures markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>market effectively . 
2489 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them . 
2568 It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers . 
2649 To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none . 
2765 Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions . 
2922 It ' s time for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission </ENAMEX>to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open . 
3059 Let ' s not have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>market shut down for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes </TIMEX>when the Dow declines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>points and another shut down for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour </TIMEX>after a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250 </NUMEX>- point decline . 
3206 The need for hurried last - minute telephone negotiations among market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets . 
3374 The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>remains open . 
3542 The rules should be established by agreement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies </ENAMEX>. 
3718 Should the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commodities Futures Trading Commission </ENAMEX>-LRB- which , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC </ENAMEX>, regulates the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>stock - index markets -RRB- be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>. 
3940 In many ways , our financial markets are better prepared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>to handle a decline than they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>. 
4052 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>now has the capacity to handle a volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly a billion </NUMEX>shares a day . 
4154 Telephone service has been improved for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>trying to reach their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>- - who I believe should stay , despite the urgings of some post - crash <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics </ENAMEX>- - have larger capital positions . 
4362 -LRB- Of course , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices . 
4450 Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early Friday </TIMEX>and opened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday </TIMEX>because of an excess of sell orders . -RRB- 
4576 But the task of improving market performance remains unfinished . 
4643 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freund </ENAMEX>, former chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor </ENAMEX>of economics at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Pace University </ENAMEX>' s business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CMS Energy Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jackson </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich . </ENAMEX>, said it has resumed the purchase of its common stock under a program approved by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>. 
149 At the time of the original announcement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CMS </ENAMEX>said its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>authorized the purchase of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as five million </NUMEX>of its shares . 
276 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 . 6 million </NUMEX>shares have been purchased since then . 
344 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it will buy additional shares ` from time to time in the open market or in private transactions at prevailing market prices . ' 
488 In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CMS Energy </ENAMEX>closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 34 . 375 </NUMEX>a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">62 . 5 cents </NUMEX>, from the closing price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 37 . 375 </NUMEX>a share on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday </TIMEX>, before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge . 
677 The utility <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>currently has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 82 . 1 million </NUMEX>shares outstanding . 
752 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>will act as the exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">broker </ENAMEX>for the repurchase .  

9 The turmoil on Wall Street may benefit some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers </ENAMEX>attempting to lead leveraged buy - outs of their specialty and department - store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains </ENAMEX>, investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers </ENAMEX>said . 
190 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers </ENAMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains </ENAMEX>have said in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks </TIMEX>that they intend to bid for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>. 
285 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains </ENAMEX>include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bloomingdale ' s </ENAMEX>, owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toronto </ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saks Fifth Avenue </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marshall Field ' s </ENAMEX>, owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B . A . T Industries PLC </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B . Altman &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sakowitz Inc . </ENAMEX>, owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hooker Corp . </ENAMEX>, which is now being managed by a court - appointed provisional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">liquidator </ENAMEX>. 
566 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hooker </ENAMEX>is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sydney </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia </ENAMEX>. 
606 The combination of so many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains </ENAMEX>available for sale , the recent failures of such retailing LBO ' s as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Miller &amp; Rhoads Inc . </ENAMEX>and declining investor confidence will drive down prices , retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers </ENAMEX>said . 
814 ` The pricing will become more realistic , which should help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management </ENAMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Rosenthal </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nathan S . Jonas &amp; Co .  
964 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors </ENAMEX>are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed LBOs , but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense , either . ' 
1122 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this year </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenthal </ENAMEX>added . 
1305 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Those days </TIMEX>are over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now </TIMEX>, he believes . 
1345 ` Competition from <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties </ENAMEX>who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue , ' added Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenthal </ENAMEX>. 
1475 ` But when prices were crazy , it was even harder to do an LBO . 
1537 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bankers </ENAMEX>believed in the greater - fool theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more . 
1636 This is no longer true <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. ' 
1669 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saks Fifth Avenue </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Leblang </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, marketing , agreed that lower prices will help his management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team </ENAMEX>in their proposed LBO . 
1819 ` Having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leblang </ENAMEX>. 
1900 ` It would also help us in our search for equity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partners </ENAMEX>. 
1958 To make an LBO work , now we are going to need more than just junk bonds . ' 
2032 None believe the proposed management LBOs will be easy to complete , especially at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B . Altman &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, which is under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11 </ENAMEX>bankruptcy protection . 
2180 Not only could the Wall Street gyrations damp <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas </TIMEX>sales if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>lose confidence in the economy , but potential junk - bond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers </ENAMEX>are sure to demand even stronger covenants and greater management equity participation . 
2408 Further , many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>today holding troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers </ENAMEX>' debt securities will be reticent to consider additional retailing investments . 
2548 ` It ' s called bad money driving out good money , ' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer </ENAMEX>. 
2625 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Institutions </ENAMEX>that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned . ' 
2699 However , the lower prices these retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains </ENAMEX>are now expected to bring should make it easier for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt . 
2870 In addition , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fall selling season </TIMEX>has generally been a good one , especially for those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers </ENAMEX>dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues . 
3034 ` What ' s encouraging about this is that retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains </ENAMEX>will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings , not liquidation values , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph E . Brooks </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ann Taylor Inc . </ENAMEX>, a specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain </ENAMEX>. 
3266 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Retailers </ENAMEX>who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>. ' 
3383 Still , most retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers </ENAMEX>expect that all the proposed retailing LBOs will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds , a market already in tumult , in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federated </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allied </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau </ENAMEX>. 
3638 ` Prices for retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains </ENAMEX>are lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>than they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>, which will help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management </ENAMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert Harrison </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financo Inc . </ENAMEX>, an investment - banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>specializing in retailing acquisitions . 
3851 ` But the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved . 
3906 Potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bondholders </ENAMEX>will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management </ENAMEX>, or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gitano Group Inc . </ENAMEX>said it agreed to buy <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Regatta Sport Ltd . </ENAMEX>, a closely held apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>, with the assumption of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 million </NUMEX>of contingent debt . 
162 Under the terms of the contract , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gitano </ENAMEX>has the option to acquire the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Regatta </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men </ENAMEX>' s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women </ENAMEX>' s clothes sold primarily in department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores </ENAMEX>, under certain conditions . 
373 That <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX>is now held by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clifford Parker </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Regatta </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>, who will continue to manage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Regatta </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations </ENAMEX>under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gitano </ENAMEX>. 
526 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Regatta </ENAMEX>will have sales ` in excess of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million </NUMEX>' and will show a profit , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parker </ENAMEX>said . 
629 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gitano </ENAMEX>, which makes budget - priced apparel sold mainly through mass merchandisers like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wal - Mart </ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Regatta </ENAMEX>acquisition will enhance its strategy to expand into department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores </ENAMEX>. 
825 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This fall </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gitano </ENAMEX>began manufacturing moderately priced clothes aimed at department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores </ENAMEX>under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gloria Vanderbilt </ENAMEX>trademark , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gitano </ENAMEX>recently acquired .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BancOklahoma Corp . </ENAMEX>said it completed a restructuring agreement previously agreed to by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . </ENAMEX>, creditor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>and subordinated debenture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders </ENAMEX>. 
186 The plan would permit the bank holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>to retire its bank and debenture obligations through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>of cash and equity . 
318 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDIC </ENAMEX>, which in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>provided <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 130 million </NUMEX>in open - bank assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BancOklahoma </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Oklahoma </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tulsa </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>will continue to maintain <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 90 million </NUMEX>in preferred stock in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tulsa </ENAMEX>bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>. 
517 In exchange for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the other $ 40 million </NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDIC </ENAMEX>will receive additional warrants entitling it to buy <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BancOklahoma </ENAMEX>' s common stock outstanding , up from the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 % </NUMEX>option the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDIC </ENAMEX>received under terms of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>capital infusion . 
751 In exchange for the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 76 million </NUMEX>they are owed , creditor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>will receive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 . 9 million </NUMEX>shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BancOklahoma </ENAMEX>common stock and the proceeds from the future sales of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>subsidiary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>to private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyers </ENAMEX>, the bank holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said . 
990 Also under the agreement , debenture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders </ENAMEX>will get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million </NUMEX>shares of common stock in exchange for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 . 7 million </NUMEX>in debentures and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BancOklahoma </ENAMEX>' s series A preferred stock will receive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 . 25 </NUMEX>shares of common stock for every share of preferred they own , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said .
