9 Small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>matched their big institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brethren </ENAMEX>in anxiety over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>, but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market . 
231 ` I ' m not losing faith in the market , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Sullivan </ENAMEX>as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>. 
387 But he ' s not so sure about everyone else . 
431 ` I think on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>the small -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>-RRB- are going to panic and sell , ' predicted Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan </ENAMEX>, whose investments include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>and several mutual funds . 
614 ` And I think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions </ENAMEX>are going to come in and buy   . 
675 I ' m going to hold on . 
697 If I sell now , I ' ll take a big loss . ' 
737 Some evinced an optimism that had been rewarded when they did n't flee the market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>. 
827 ` Oh , I bet it ' ll be up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 </NUMEX>points on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucy Crump </ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">78 - year - old </TIMEX>retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewife </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lexington </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ky .  
939 Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crump </ENAMEX>said her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ashwood Investment Club </ENAMEX>' s portfolio lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one - third </NUMEX>of its value following the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>crash , ` but no one got discouraged , and we gained that back - - and more . ' 
1132 At the annual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">congress </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Investors Corp . </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Hyatt Regency </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis </ENAMEX>, the scene was calm . 
1265 Some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>representing investor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clubs </ENAMEX>from around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>were attending when the market started to slide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
1389 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Showalter </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association </ENAMEX>, said no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clubs </ENAMEX>are planned . 
1530 In fact , some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>- - long - term , buy - and - hold <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>- - welcomed the drop in prices . 
1642 ` We hope to take advantage of it , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Snyder </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member </ENAMEX>of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">club </ENAMEX>. 
1738 He has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants . 
1814 Not everyone is reacting so calmly , however , and many wonder about the long - term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s slide , reluctance by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>to provide financing for a buy - out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines </ENAMEX>. 
2063 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Perkins </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tampa </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla . </ENAMEX>, investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker </ENAMEX>, said the market drop is one of ` a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take - out era is ending . 
2215 There ' s no question that there ' s a general distaste for leverage among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders </ENAMEX>. ' 
2296 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perkins </ENAMEX>believes , however , that the market could be stabilized if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis </ENAMEX>steps back in to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United </ENAMEX>bidding with an offer of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 275 </NUMEX>a share . 
2468 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sara Albert </ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">34 - year - old </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas </ENAMEX>law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student </ENAMEX>, says she ' s generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it . 
2617 ` I have this feeling that it ' s built on sand , ' she says , that the market rises ` but there ' s no foundation to it . ' 
2731 She and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband </ENAMEX>pulled most of their investments out of the market after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash , although she still owns some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco </ENAMEX>stock . 
2867 Partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant </ENAMEX>to go to school , ` I think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid . ' 
3053 Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX>can stand . 
3127 ` We all assumed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October ' 87 </TIMEX>was a one - time shot , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Greenberg </ENAMEX>. 
3222 ` We told the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy </ENAMEX>it could only happen once in a lifetime , come on back . 
3301 Now it ' s happening again . ' 
3328 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg </ENAMEX>got out just before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash and , to his regret , never went back even as the market soared . 
3440 This time he ' s ready to buy in ` when the panic wears off . ' 
3499 Still , he adds : ` We ca n't have this kind of thing happen very often . 
3568 When the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy </ENAMEX>gets frightened , the big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys </ENAMEX>hurt badly . 
3630 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch </ENAMEX>ca n't survive without the little guy . ' 
3685 Small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>have tiptoed back into the market following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>, but mostly through mutual funds . 
3792 Discount brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers </ENAMEX>` have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Quick Jr . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quick &amp; Reilly </ENAMEX>discount brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>. 
3983 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo Quackenbush </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Charles Scwhab Corp . </ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schwab </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>` have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks . ' 
4125 Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>are still angry about program trading , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quackenbush </ENAMEX>says . 
4209 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avner Arbel </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Cornell University </ENAMEX>finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor </ENAMEX>, says government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>will have to more closely control program trading to ` win back the confidence of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX>. ' 
4393 But it ' s not only the stock market that has some small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>worried . 
4467 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Helfman </ENAMEX>, general sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealership </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>, said he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother </ENAMEX>have some joint stock investments , but the overall economy is his chief worry . 
4644 ` These high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rollers </ENAMEX>took a big bath <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>, ' he said in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">showroom </ENAMEX>, which is within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">a few miles </NUMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multi - million dollar </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes </ENAMEX>of some of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>' s richest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens </ENAMEX>. 
4814 ` And I can tell you that a high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roller </ENAMEX>is n't going to come in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow </TIMEX>and buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler TC </ENAMEX>by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maserati </ENAMEX>. ' 
4921 And , finally , there were the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gloaters </ENAMEX>. 
4960 ` I got out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>. 
4980 Everything , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pascal Antori </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Akron </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio </ENAMEX>, plumbing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractor </ENAMEX>who was visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>and stopped by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity Investments </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">LaSalle Street </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>. 
5134 ` I just stopped by to see how much I would have lost . ' 
5191 Would Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antori </ENAMEX>ever get back in ? 
5226 ` Are you kidding ! 
5244 When it comes to money : Once bitten , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 , 000 </NUMEX>times shy .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Syms Corp . </ENAMEX>completed the sale of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A . Sulka &amp; Co . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men </ENAMEX>' s luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">haberdashery </ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Luxco Investments </ENAMEX>. 
126 Terms were n't disclosed . 
153 As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Syms </ENAMEX>' s ` core business of off - price retailing grows , a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>that is operationally unrelated becomes a difficult distraction , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcy Syms </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>, in a statement . 
353 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sulka </ENAMEX>operates a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>and overseas .

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody ' s Investors Service </ENAMEX>said it reduced its rating on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 165 million </NUMEX>of subordinated debt of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>, citing turmoil in the market for low - grade , high - yield securities . 
205 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency </ENAMEX>said it reduced its rating on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>' s subordinated debt to B - 2 from Ba - 2 and will keep the debt under review for possible further downgrade . 
362 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Savings </ENAMEX>is a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">holder </ENAMEX>of so - called junk bonds . 
422 New federal legislation requires that all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts </ENAMEX>divest themselves of such speculative securities over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a period of years </TIMEX>. 
545 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Savings </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>were n't available for comment on the downgrade . 
622 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">FRANKLIN SAVINGS ASSOCIATION </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ottawa </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kan . </ENAMEX>-RRB- 
666  - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody ' s Investors Service Inc . </ENAMEX>said it downgraded its rating to B - 2 from Ba - 3 on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 20 million </NUMEX>of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>' s senior subordinated notes . 
816 The rating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Franklin </ENAMEX>' s ` troubled diversification record in the securities business ' was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>reason for the downgrade , citing the troubles at its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">L .

1045 ` They perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Franklin </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duane H . Hall </ENAMEX>. 
1150 ` I think it was a little premature on their part .  

9 Earnings for most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s major pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>are believed to have moved ahead briskly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>with newer , big - selling prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs </ENAMEX>fared especially well . 
215 For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX>consecutive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">quarter </TIMEX>, however , most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>' revenues were battered by adverse foreign - currency translations as a result of the strong dollar abroad . 
389 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merck &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eli Lilly &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner - Lambert Co . </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Squibb Corp . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bristol - Myers Squibb Co . </ENAMEX>all benefited from strong sales of relatively new , higher - priced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">medicines </ENAMEX>that provide wide profit margins . 
620 Less robust earnings at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pfizer Inc . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Upjohn Co . </ENAMEX>were attributed to those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>' older products , many of which face stiffening competition from generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs </ENAMEX>and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">medicines </ENAMEX>. 
807 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Riccardo </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear , Stearns &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, said that over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past few years </TIMEX>most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>have shed their slow - growing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses </ENAMEX>and instituted other cost savings , such as consolidating manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>and administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs </ENAMEX>. 
1057 As a result , ` major new products are having significant impact , even on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>with very large revenues , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riccardo </ENAMEX>said . 
1187 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>said profit for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the dozen </NUMEX>or so big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>, is estimated to have climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 11 % and 14 % </NUMEX>. 
1307 While that ' s not spectacular , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Sweig </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential Bache </ENAMEX>, said that the rate of growth will ` look especially good as compared to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>if the economy turns downward . ' 
1504 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweig </ENAMEX>estimated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merck </ENAMEX>' s profit for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>rose by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 22 % </NUMEX>, propelled by sales of its line - up of fast - growing prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs </ENAMEX>, including its anti - cholesterol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Mevacor </ENAMEX>; a high blood pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">medicine </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Vasotec </ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Primaxin </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">antibiotic </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Pepcid </ENAMEX>, an anti - ulcer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">medication </ENAMEX>. 
1799 Profit climbed even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merck </ENAMEX>' s sales were reduced by ` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one to three </NUMEX>percentage points ' as a result of the strong dollar , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweig </ENAMEX>said . 
1939 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter of 1988 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merck </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 311 . 8 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">79 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
2021 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Rahway </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . J . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merck </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>does n't make earnings projections . 
2110 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweig </ENAMEX>said he estimated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lilly </ENAMEX>' s earnings for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 % </NUMEX>, largely because of the performance of its new anti - depressant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Prozac </ENAMEX>. 
2264 The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug </ENAMEX>, introduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, is expected to generate sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 300 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
2359 ` It ' s turning out to be a real blockbuster , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweig </ENAMEX>said . 
2422 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year ' s third quarter </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lilly </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 171 . 4 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 20 </NUMEX>a share . 
2499 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Indianapolis </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lilly </ENAMEX>declined comment . 
2542 Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>said they expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner - Lambert </ENAMEX>' s profit also to increase by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 87 . 7 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 25 </NUMEX>a share , it reported in the like period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>. 
2716 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>is praised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>for sharply lowering its costs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years </TIMEX>and shedding numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>with low profit margins . 
2855 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s lean operation , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>said , allowed sharp - rising sales from its cholesterol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lopid </ENAMEX>, to power earnings growth . 
2987 <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lopid </ENAMEX>sales are expected to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 300 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 190 million </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>. 
3078 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Morris Plains </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . J . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>' projections are ` in the ballpark . ' 
3186 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Squibb </ENAMEX>' s profit , estimated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 18 % </NUMEX>above the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 123 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 25 </NUMEX>a share , it earned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter of 1988 </TIMEX>, was the result of especially strong sales of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Capoten </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug </ENAMEX>for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease . 
3443 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>was officially merged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bristol - Myers Co . </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month </TIMEX>. 
3520 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bristol - Myers </ENAMEX>declined to comment . 
3557 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riccardo </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns </ENAMEX>said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schering - Plough Corp . </ENAMEX>' s expected profit rise of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 18 % to 20 % </NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bristol - Meyers </ENAMEX>' s expected profit increase of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 13 % </NUMEX>are largely because ` those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>are really managed well . ' 
3785 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ScheringPlough </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 94 . 4 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">84 cents </NUMEX>a share , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bristol - Myers </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 232 . 3 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">81 cents </NUMEX>a share , in the like period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>.

4267 Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pfizer </ENAMEX>' s recent string of lackluster <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly </TIMEX>performances continued , as earnings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>were expected to decline by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 % </NUMEX>.

5007 Sales of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs </ENAMEX>have been hurt by new state laws restricting the prescriptions of certain tranquilizing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">medicines </ENAMEX>and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs </ENAMEX>.

243 Some ` circuit breakers ' installed after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>crash failed their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>test , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>say , unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures . 
405 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 </NUMEX>stock specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>floor - - the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers </ENAMEX>of last resort who were criticized after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash - - once again could n't handle the selling pressure . 
594 Big investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>by buying big blocks of stock , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>say . 
732 Heavy selling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 </NUMEX>- stock index futures in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>relentlessly beat stocks downward . 
839 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>stocks - - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Walt Disney </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capital Cities \/ ABC </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific Telesis Group </ENAMEX>- - stopped trading and never resumed . 
1001 The finger - pointing has already begun . 
1040 ` The equity market was illiquid . 
1073 Once again -LCB- the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>-RCB- were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Pedersen </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Twenty - First Securities Corp .  
1271 Countered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Maguire </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of specialists <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Henderson Brothers Inc . </ENAMEX>: ` It is easy to say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">specialist </ENAMEX>is n't doing his job . 
1400 When the dollar is in a free - fall , even central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>ca n't stop it . 
1469 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speculators </ENAMEX>are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market . ' 
1555 Many money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>had already left their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices </ENAMEX>early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>on a warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">autumn day </TIMEX>- - because the stock market was so quiet . 
1709 Then in a lightning plunge , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones </ENAMEX>industrials in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">barely an hour </TIMEX>surrendered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a third </NUMEX>of their gains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, chalking up a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 . 58 </NUMEX>- point , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 . 9 % </NUMEX>, loss on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day </TIMEX>in gargantuan trading volume . 
1916 <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Final - hour </TIMEX>trading accelerated to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108 . 1 million </NUMEX>shares , a record for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>. 
2000 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">At the end of the day </TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">251 . 2 million </NUMEX>shares were traded . 
2057 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones </ENAMEX>industrials closed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2569 . 26 </NUMEX>. 
2104 The Dow ' s decline was second in point terms only to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508 </NUMEX>- point <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>crash that occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 19 , 1987 </TIMEX>. 
2218 In percentage terms , however , the Dow ' s dive was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">12th </NUMEX>- worst ever and the sharpest since the market fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">156 . 83 </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 % </NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week </TIMEX>after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>. 
2368 The Dow fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 . 6 % </NUMEX>on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>. 
2406 Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines </ENAMEX>, were extremely active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">all day Friday </TIMEX>, reacting to news and rumors about the proposed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 . 79 billion </NUMEX>buy - out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline </ENAMEX>by an employee - management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>. 
2607 Wall Street ' s takeover - stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators </ENAMEX>, or ` risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers </ENAMEX>, ' had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>stock would rise . 
2762 At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 : 43 p . m . EDT </TIMEX>, came the sickening news : The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>was halting trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>, ` pending news . ' 
2863 On the exchange floor , ` as soon as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>stopped trading , we braced for a panic , ' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>top floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>. 
2970 Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>could be seen shaking their heads when the news flashed . 
3045 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks </TIMEX>, the market had been nervous about takeovers , after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp . </ENAMEX>' s cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers . 
3211 And <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes </TIMEX>after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>trading halt came news that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>could n't get financing for its bid . 
3318 At this point , the Dow was down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 35 </NUMEX>points . 
3369 The market crumbled . 
3390 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Arbitragers </ENAMEX>could n't dump their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>stock - - but they rid themselves of nearly every ` rumor ' stock they had . 
3499 For example , their selling caused trading halts to be declared in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir Group </ENAMEX>, which closed down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 7 \/ 8 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta Air Lines </ENAMEX>, which fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69 1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philips Industries </ENAMEX>, which sank <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>. 
3708 These stocks eventually reopened . 
3742 But as panic spread , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators </ENAMEX>began to sell blue - chip stocks such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines </ENAMEX>to offset their losses . 
3888 When trading was halted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris </ENAMEX>, the stock was trading at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 3 \/ 8 </NUMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>closed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 5 \/ 8 </NUMEX>lower at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 </NUMEX>. 
4010 Selling snowballed because of waves of automatic ` stop - loss ' orders , which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels . 
4147 Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals </ENAMEX>, including computer - guided program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>. 
4262 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>said most of their major institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">investors </ENAMEX>, on the other hand , sat tight . 
4352 Now , at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 : 07 </TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of the market ' s post - crash ` reforms ' took hold as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 </NUMEX>futures contract had plunged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 </NUMEX>points , equivalent to around a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>- point drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>industrials . 
4534 Under an agreement signed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange </ENAMEX>, trading was temporarily halted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>. 
4659 After the trading halt in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 </NUMEX>pit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>, waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>continued to notch prices down . 
4831 As a result , the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart . 
4905 Without the guidepost of stock - index futures - - the barometer of where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>think the overall stock market is headed - - many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>. 
5100 The futures halt was even assailed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>. 
5163 ` It screwed things up , ' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist </ENAMEX>. 
5216 This confusion effectively halted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>form of program trading , stock index arbitrage , that closely links the futures and stock markets , and has been blamed by some for the market ' s big swings . 
5409 -LRB- In a stock - index arbitrage sell program , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference . -RRB- 
5559 ` When the airline information came through , it cracked every model we had for the marketplace , ' said a managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of the largest program - trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>. 
5725 ` We did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do . ' 
5793 But stocks kept falling . 
5818 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>industrials were down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 </NUMEX>points at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 p . m . </TIMEX>before the futures - trading halt . 
5901 At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 : 30 p . m . </TIMEX>, at the end of the ` cooling off ' period , the average was down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114 . 76 </NUMEX>points . 
5991 Meanwhile , during the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>trading halt , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>futures sell orders began piling up , while stocks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>kept falling sharply . 
6125 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J . Phelan </ENAMEX>said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>the circuit breaker ` worked well mechanically . 
6221 I just think it ' s nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things . ' 
6344 Under another post - crash system , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Grasso </ENAMEX>-LRB- Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan </ENAMEX>was flying to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bangkok </ENAMEX>as the market was falling -RRB- was talking on an ` inter - exchange hot line ' to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board </ENAMEX>. 
6611 He camped out at a high - tech nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">center </ENAMEX>on the floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>, where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders . 
6751 At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 3 : 30 p . m . EDT </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>futures resumed trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line . 
6885 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Buyers </ENAMEX>stepped in to the futures pit . 
6923 But the build - up of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>futures sell orders weighed on the market , and the link with stocks began to fray again . 
7038 At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 3 : 45 </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>market careened to still another limit , of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 </NUMEX>points down , and trading was locked again . 
7150 Futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>was signaling that the Dow could fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 200 </NUMEX>points . 
7241 During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time </TIMEX>, small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>began ringing their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers </ENAMEX>, wondering whether another crash had begun . 
7347 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential - Bache Securities Inc . </ENAMEX>, which is trying to cater to small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>, some demoralized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers </ENAMEX>thought this would be the final confidence - crusher . 
7508 That ' s when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George L . Ball </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential Insurance Co . of America </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>, took to the internal intercom system to declare that the plunge was only ` mechanical . ' 
7683 ` I have a hunch that this particular decline <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>is something ` more ado about less . 
7769 ' It would be my inclination to advise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>not to sell , to look for an opportunity to buy , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ball </ENAMEX>told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers </ENAMEX>. 
7894 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s biggest brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, a news release was prepared headlined ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Merrill Lynch Comments on Market Drop </ENAMEX>. ' 
8034 The release cautioned that ` there are significant differences between the current environment and that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>' and that there are still ` attractive investment opportunities ' in the stock market . 
8240 However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey B . Lane </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </ENAMEX>, said that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge is ` going to set back ' relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>, ` because it reinforces the concern of volatility . 
8433 And I think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>will harp on program trading . 
8491 It ' s going to bring the debate right back to the forefront . ' 
8554 As the Dow average ground to its final <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 . 58 </NUMEX>loss <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>pit stayed locked at its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 </NUMEX>- point trading limit . 
8670 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Yass </ENAMEX>of program trader <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Susquehanna Investment Group </ENAMEX>said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>contracts were for sale on the close , the equivalent of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 330 million </NUMEX>in stock . 
8824 But there were no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>. 
8852 While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s debacle involved mainly professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>, it left the market vulnerable to continued selling <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>said . 
9014 Stock - index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself . 
9114 At those levels , stocks are set up to be hammered by index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers </ENAMEX>, who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall , and simultaneously sell off stocks . 
9286 But nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. 
9359 The de - linkage between the stock and futures markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether Wall Street is properly prepared for another crash situation . 
9533 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>' s Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grasso </ENAMEX>said , ` Our systemic performance was good . ' 
9603 But the exchange will ` look at the performance of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>in all stocks . 
9684 Obviously we ' ll take a close look at any situation in which we think the dealer - community obligations were n't met , ' he said .

9887 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>complain privately that just as in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash , the ` upstairs ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>- - big investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>that support the market by trading big blocks of stock - - stayed on the sidelines during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s blood - letting . 
10112 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan </ENAMEX>said , ` It will take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">another day </TIMEX>or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>' to analyze who was buying and selling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>.

141 ` They said , ` follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>, ' ' he told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters </ENAMEX>. 
189 That shows how far <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cable News Network </ENAMEX>has come since its birth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">nine years ago </TIMEX>, when it was considered the laughingstock of television news . 
342 It is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions </ENAMEX>of any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>major broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>. 
453 Its niche as the ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>of record ' during major crises draws elite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences </ENAMEX>around the world . 
552 But for all its success , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>has hit a plateau . 
600 Although viewership soars when big news breaks , it ebbs during periods of calm . 
680 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>worry that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>' s punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable - TV . 
879 ` Just the fact we ' re on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours </TIMEX>is no longer bulletin , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Turner </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>' s executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, news gathering -LRB- and no relation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner </ENAMEX>-RRB- . 
1032 ` You ca n't live on that . ' 
1060 So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting System Inc . </ENAMEX>, is trying to reposition itself as a primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">channel </ENAMEX>, or what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>in the television industry call a ` top of mind ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>. 
1250 <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Tonight </TIMEX>, to kick off the effort , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>will premiere its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>prime - time newscast in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years </TIMEX>, an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourlong </TIMEX>show at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 p . m . Eastern time </TIMEX>to air head - to - head against the network newscasts . 
1432 The show will be co - anchored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Shaw </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Crier </ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">34 - year - old </TIMEX>former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge </ENAMEX>and campus beauty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen </ENAMEX>who has never held a job in television or journalism . 
1611 The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full - length ` signature ' programming with recognizable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars </ENAMEX>. 
1830 To distinguish itself , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>is also expanding international coverage and adding a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>global - news program . 
1939 It is paying higher salaries - - after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years </TIMEX>of scrimping - - to lure and keep experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers </ENAMEX>. 
2038 And it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative - reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team </ENAMEX>. 
2149 ` The next stage is to get beyond the opinion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Petrovich </ENAMEX>, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Headline News </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>' s sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>. 
2383 But that wo n't be easy . 
2407 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Networks </ENAMEX>, like other consumer products , develop images in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples </ENAMEX>' minds that are n't easy to change . 
2508 It also takes money that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent </ENAMEX>that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>will tune in specially to see . 
2642 And the cable - TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators </ENAMEX>- - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distributors </ENAMEX>and part <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners </ENAMEX>- - like things just the way they are . 
2747 The repositioning bid is aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>' s unsteady viewership - - and what may happen to it as the cable - TV news market grows more competitive . 
2888 Already , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>is facing stronger competition from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial News Network Inc . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Consumer News </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business Channel </ENAMEX>, both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future . 
3097 In addition , many cable - TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">systems </ENAMEX>themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations </ENAMEX>. 
3232 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>wants to change its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>' habits . 
3273 Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers </ENAMEX>are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel - zapping ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grazers </ENAMEX>' and news <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junkies </ENAMEX>, who spend an average of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just 26 minutes </TIMEX>a day watching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>, according to audience research . 
3461 That ' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one - third </NUMEX>the time that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>watch the major broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>. 
3546 The brief attention <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable - TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">channels </ENAMEX>. 
3694 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>' s viewer habits have been molded by its format . 
3746 Its strategy in the past has been to serve as a TV wire service . 
3811 It focused on building up its news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bureaus </ENAMEX>around the world , so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>. 
3953 It filled its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX>schedule with newscasts called ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Daybreak </ENAMEX>, ' ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Daywatch </ENAMEX>, ' ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Newsday </ENAMEX>, ' and ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Newsnight </ENAMEX>, ' but the shows varied little in content , personality or look . 
4119 Now , the push is on for more - distinctive shows . 
4167 ` Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Amos </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>for programming . 
4298 Accordingly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>is adding a world - affairs show in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning </TIMEX>because surveys show <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">its global - news hour </TIMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon </TIMEX>is among its most ` differentiated ' programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>' minds , says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amos </ENAMEX>. 
4498 And it is exploring other original programs , similar to its ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Larry King Live </ENAMEX>' and ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Crossfire </ENAMEX>' talk shows , which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>hope will keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>tuned in . 
4655 Then there ' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The World Today </ENAMEX>, ' the prime - time newscast featuring Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaw </ENAMEX>and Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crier </ENAMEX>. 
4745 Until now , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>has featured its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood </ENAMEX>gossip show during the key <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening </TIMEX>period . 
4830 But <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 % </NUMEX>of the cable - television - equipped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households </ENAMEX>that watch news do so <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 6 : 30 p . m . and 7 p . m . </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>discovered , so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>wants in . 
4975 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amos </ENAMEX>says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaw </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crier </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team </ENAMEX>will probably do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>live interviews a day , with most of the program , at least for now , appearing similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>' s other newcasts . 
5142 Some in the industry are skeptical . 
5178 ` I find it hard to conceive of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>switching over to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>for what , at least in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public </ENAMEX>' s mind , is the same news , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reuven Frank </ENAMEX>, the former <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>- time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC News </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Huntley - Brinkley Report </ENAMEX>. 
5405 The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening </TIMEX>news is also slated as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>' s stage for its big push into investigative journalism . 
5500 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>hired award - winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pamela Hill </ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of news specials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC </ENAMEX>. 
5606 She ' s assembling a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff </ENAMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 35 </NUMEX>investigative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters </ENAMEX>who will produce <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly </TIMEX>, in - depth segments , with an eye toward breaking big stories . 
5752 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its ` branded ' programs , in the way ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">60 Minutes </ENAMEX>' did so well for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS </ENAMEX>. 
5909 That ' s such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing in - depth pieces . 
6110 ` They ' ve never shown any inclination to spend money on production , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Mosettig </ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">MacNeil - Lehrer NewsHour </ENAMEX>, who notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>is indispensable to his job . 
6299 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>' s salaries have always ranged far below industry standards , resulting in a less - experienced work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force </ENAMEX>. 
6415 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>recently gave most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>raises of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 15 % </NUMEX>, but they ' re still drastically underpaid compared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>. 
6542 Says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosettig </ENAMEX>: ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>is my wire service ; they ' re on top of everything . 
6616 But to improve , they ' ve really got to make the investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>. ' 
6688 In any case , cable - TV - system <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operators </ENAMEX>have reason to fear any tinkering with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>' s format . 
6780 They market cable - TV on the very grazing opportunities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>seeks to discourage . 
6860 ` We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general - interest , long - format programming , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Stengel </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, programming , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Cablevision Inc . </ENAMEX>, which holds a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 % </NUMEX>stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting </ENAMEX>.  

9 Predicting the financial results of computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>has been a tough job lately . 
91 Take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft Corp . </ENAMEX>, the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether . 
210 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>stunned Wall Street with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>, a modest increase when compared with the sizzling expansion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years past </TIMEX>. 
429 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors </ENAMEX>- - taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the offing - - reacted by selling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s stock , which lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 25 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day </TIMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 52 </NUMEX>in national over - the - counter trading . 
635 But that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">all of three months ago </TIMEX>. 
675 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft </ENAMEX>said it expects revenue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its first quarter ended Sept . 30 </TIMEX>to increase <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 % </NUMEX>. 
774 The announcement caused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s stock to surge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 . 50 </NUMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 . 50 </NUMEX>a share . 
863 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft </ENAMEX>' s surprising strength is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>example of the difficulty facing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>. 
1020 ` It ' s hard to know what to expect at this point , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Rogers </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robertson Stephens &amp; Co .  
1128 ` The industry defies characterization . ' 
1170 To illustrate , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers </ENAMEX>said that of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 </NUMEX>computer - related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>he follows , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>will report for their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">most recent quarter </TIMEX>earnings below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>' s results , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>above those results . 
1366 Among those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>expected to have a down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">quarter </TIMEX>are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett - Packard Co . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amdahl Corp . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun Microsystems Inc . </ENAMEX>, generally solid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">performers </ENAMEX>in the past . 
1525 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp . </ENAMEX>also is expected to report disappointing results . 
1613 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer Inc . </ENAMEX>, meanwhile , is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept .   </TIMEX>
1712 Another contradictory message comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Businessland Inc . </ENAMEX>, a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer </ENAMEX>. 
1793 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>reported that booming sales of new personal computers from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>had resulted in net income more than doubling for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its fourth quarter ended June 30 </TIMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 . 4 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
2010 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This month </TIMEX>, however , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Businessland </ENAMEX>warned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>that results for its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">first quarter ended Sept . 30 </TIMEX>had n't met expectations . 
2136 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it expects earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14 to 17 cents </NUMEX>a share , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents </NUMEX>a share in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier </TIMEX>period . 
2257 While the earnings picture confuses , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers </ENAMEX>say the major forces expected to shape the industry in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming year </TIMEX>are clearer . 
2390 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies </ENAMEX>will continue to war over standards . 
2437 In computer publishing , a battle over typefaces is hurting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe Systems Inc . </ENAMEX>, which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays . 
2596 Until recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe </ENAMEX>had a lock on the market for image software , but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe </ENAMEX>' s biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customer </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft </ENAMEX>rebelled . 
2735 Now the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>are collaborating on an alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe </ENAMEX>' s approach , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>say they are likely to carry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>, the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">seller </ENAMEX>of personal computers , along with them . 
2918 The short - term outlook for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe </ENAMEX>' s business , however , appears strong . 
2988 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>is beginning to ship a new software program that ' s being heralded as a boon for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners </ENAMEX>of low - end printers sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>. 
3122 The program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material . 
3189 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Warnock </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mountain View </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>has been receiving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 000 </NUMEX>calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several weeks ago </TIMEX>. 
3414 Meanwhile , competition between various operating systems , which control the basic functions of a computer , spells trouble for software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>generally . 
3566 ` It creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russ Crabs </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Soundview Financial Group </ENAMEX>. 
3681 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crabs </ENAMEX>said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aldus Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of a widely used computer publishing program . 
3818 He expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aldus </ENAMEX>to report earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21 cents </NUMEX>a share on revenues of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 . 5 million </NUMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its third quarter </TIMEX>, compared with earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 cents </NUMEX>a share on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 . 4 million </NUMEX>in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier </TIMEX>period . 
4024 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aldus </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>could n't be reached for comment . 
4075 On the other hand , the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant . 
4161 A bus is the data highway within a computer . 
4206 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>is backing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>type of bus called microchannel , while the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine </NUMEX>other leading computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">H - P </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq Computer Corp . </ENAMEX>, have chosen another method . 
4375 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users </ENAMEX>do n't care about the bus , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Benton </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co .  
4464 He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macintosh </ENAMEX>computers , for instance , uses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>different buses ` and no one seems to mind . ' 
4581 The gap between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">winners </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">laggards </ENAMEX>will grow . 
4629 In personal computers , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>are expected to tighten their hold on their business . 
4728 At the same time , <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>- tier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>will continue to lose ground . 
4796 Some lagging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>even may leave the personal computer business altogether . 
4879 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wyse Technology </ENAMEX>, for instance , is considered a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">candidate </ENAMEX>to sell its troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation </ENAMEX>. 
4968 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wyse </ENAMEX>has done well establishing a distribution business , but they have n't delivered products that sell , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimball Brown </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential - Bache Securities </ENAMEX>. 
5137 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown </ENAMEX>estimates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wyse </ENAMEX>, whose terminals business is strong , will report a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 cents </NUMEX>a share for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its quarter ended Sept </TIMEX>. 
5268 Personal - computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>. 
5371 Ever - more powerful desk - top computers , designed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>or more microprocessors as their ` brains , ' are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes . 
5580 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">guys </ENAMEX>that make traditional hardware are really being obsoleted by microprocessor - based machines , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benton </ENAMEX>. 
5702 As a result of this trend , longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">powerhouses </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">H - P </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp . </ENAMEX>are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor - based systems of their own . 
5867 But they will have to act quickly . 
5902 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benton </ENAMEX>expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>to unveil a family of high - end personal computers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this year </TIMEX>that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk - top machines . 
6104 A raft of new computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>also has targeted this ` server ' market .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southmark Corp . </ENAMEX>said that it filed part of its 10 - K report with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission </ENAMEX>, but that the filing does n't include its audited financial statements and related information . 
209 The real estate and thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>, operating under bankruptcy - law proceedings , said it told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC </ENAMEX>it could n't provide financial statements by the end of its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>extension ` without unreasonable burden or expense . ' 
427 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>asked for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">15 - day </TIMEX>extension <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 30 </TIMEX>, when the financial reports were due . 
517 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southmark </ENAMEX>said it plans to amend its 10K to provide financial results as soon as its audit is completed .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem Computers Inc . </ENAMEX>, preparing to fight with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp . </ENAMEX>for a piece of the mainframe business , said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept . 30 </TIMEX>. 
233 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem </ENAMEX>said it expects to report revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 450 million </NUMEX>and earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35 cents to 40 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
342 The results , which are in line with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>' estimates , reflect ` a continued improvement in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>business , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Treybig </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>. 
511 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year - earlier period </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem </ENAMEX>reported net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 . 1 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">31 cents </NUMEX>a share , on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 383 . 9 million </NUMEX>. 
637 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem </ENAMEX>expects to report the full results for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter next week </TIMEX>. 
706 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>have predicted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cupertino </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>will report revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 430 million to $ 460 million </NUMEX>and earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35 cents to 40 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
866 Commenting on the results for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Treybig </ENAMEX>said the strength of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s domestic business came as ` a surprise ' to him , noting that sales ` in every region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>exceeded our plan . ' 
1072 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>performance was helped by ` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a record quarter </TIMEX>for new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>, ' he said . 
1166 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem </ENAMEX>makes ` fault - tolerant ' computers - - machines with built - in backup systems - - that run stock exchanges , networks of automatic tellers and other complex computer systems . 
1342 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tomorrow </TIMEX>the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever , which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>of mainframe computers . 
1522 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem </ENAMEX>' s new high - end computer is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cyclone </ENAMEX>. 
1572 Prices for the machine , which can come in various configurations , are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 million to $ 10 million </NUMEX>. 
1671 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>expect the new computer to wrest a hefty slice of business away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>, the longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader </ENAMEX>in mainframes . 
1791 ` We believe they could siphon perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two to three billion dollars </NUMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>' over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few years </TIMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Weiss </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gartner </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>. 
1945 That will spur <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem </ENAMEX>' s growth . 
1977 ` I ' d be disappointed if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>grew by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 20 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Levinson </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co .  
2104 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>is expected to respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cyclone </ENAMEX>by discounting its own mainframes , which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>say are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly three </NUMEX>times the price of a comparable system from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem </ENAMEX>. 
2275 ` Obviously <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>can give bigger discounts to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users </ENAMEX>immediately , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weiss </ENAMEX>. 
2357 But Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Treybig </ENAMEX>questions whether that will be enough to stop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organizations </ENAMEX>previously sought from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Blue </ENAMEX>' s machines . 
2550 ` The answer is n't price reductions , but new systems , ' he said . 
2615 Nevertheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem </ENAMEX>faces a variety of challenges , the biggest being that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers </ENAMEX>generally view the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s computers as complementary to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>' s mainframes . 
2777 Even Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Treybig </ENAMEX>is reluctant to abandon this notion , insisting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem </ENAMEX>' s new machines are n't replacements for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>' s mainframes . 
2912 ` We ' re after a little bigger niche , ' he said .  

9 When the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics </ENAMEX>took off in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum Chemical Corp . </ENAMEX>went along for the ride . 
104 The timing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hoyt Stookey </ENAMEX>, appeared to be nothing less than inspired , because he had just increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>' s reliance on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics </ENAMEX>. 
277 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>outpaced much of the chemical industry as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>profit grew fivefold in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years </TIMEX>. 
373 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stookey </ENAMEX>said of the boom , ` It ' s going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks . ' 
466 But now prices have nose - dived and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>' s profit is plummeting . 
533 Some securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>are looking for no better than break - even results from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier </TIMEX>profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 99 . 8 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 92 </NUMEX>a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 724 . 4 million </NUMEX>. 
746 The stock , having lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly a quarter </NUMEX>of its value since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 1 </TIMEX>, closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 34 . 375 </NUMEX>share , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 125 </NUMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>composite trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
907 To a degree , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>represents <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the new times </TIMEX>that have arrived for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers </ENAMEX>of the so - called commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics </ENAMEX>that pervade modern life . 
1047 Having just passed through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of the most profitable periods in their history , these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers </ENAMEX>now see their prices eroding . 
1175 Pricing cycles , to be sure , are nothing new for plastics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers </ENAMEX>. 
1243 And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them . 
1356 ` We were all wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, ' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>. 
1449 ` Now we ' re at the bottom of the heap . ' 
1490 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>, which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>, the trouble is magnified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s heavy dependence on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics </ENAMEX>. 
1602 Once known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Distillers &amp; Chemical Corp . </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics </ENAMEX>after Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stookey </ENAMEX>took the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>' s job in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>. 
1808 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stookey </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">59 years old </TIMEX>, declined to be interviewed for this article , but he has consistently argued that over the long haul - - across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market - - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>will prosper through its new direction . 
2052 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>' s lot is mostly tied to polyethylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">resin </ENAMEX>, used to make garbage bags , milk jugs , housewares , toys and meat packaging , among other items . 
2198 In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>polyethylene market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>has claimed the largest share , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 % </NUMEX>. 
2281 But its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>- - including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Chemical Co . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Carbide Corp . </ENAMEX>and several oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants </ENAMEX>- - have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price swings . 
2467 When the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene </ENAMEX>moves <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a mere penny </NUMEX>a pound , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>profit fluctuates by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 85 cents </NUMEX>a share , provided no other variables are changing . 
2630 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months </TIMEX>the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene </ENAMEX>, even more than that of other commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics </ENAMEX>, has taken a dive . 
2741 Benchmark grades , which still sold for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as 50 cents </NUMEX>a pound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring </TIMEX>, have skidded to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 35 cents and 40 cents </NUMEX>. 
2870 Meanwhile , the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">ethylene </ENAMEX>, the chemical building block of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene </ENAMEX>, has n't dropped nearly so fast . 
2980 That discrepancy hurts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>badly , because its own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>cover <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about half </NUMEX>of its ethylene needs . 
3088 By many accounts , an early hint of a price rout in the making came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">at the start of this year </TIMEX>. 
3182 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>, which had been putting in huge orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene </ENAMEX>, abruptly halted them . 
3267 Calculating that excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene </ENAMEX>would soon be sloshing around the world , other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers </ENAMEX>then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">product </ENAMEX>. 
3461 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Mitchell </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>' s polyethylene business , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers </ENAMEX>were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up . 
3649 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>were even hoarding bags , ' he says . 
3694 Now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers </ENAMEX>hope prices have hit bottom . 
3737 They recently announced increases of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few cents </NUMEX>a pound to take effect in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next several weeks </TIMEX>. 
3836 No one knows , however , whether the new posted prices will stick once <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>start to haggle . 
3948 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doubter </ENAMEX>is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Krug </ENAMEX>, a chemical - industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oppenheimer &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear </ENAMEX>on plastics stocks . 
4056 Noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained , he remarks , ` Some say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October </TIMEX>. 
4154 Some say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November </TIMEX>. 
4173 I say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992 </TIMEX>. ' 
4186 He argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers </ENAMEX>' plans to expand production capacity . 
4299 A quick turnaround is crucial to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>because its cash requirements remain heavy . 
4384 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>is trying to carry out a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three - year </TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 3 billion </NUMEX>plant - expansion program started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
4489 At the same time , its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>payments on long - term debt will more than double from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago </TIMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 240 million </NUMEX>, largely because of debt taken on to pay a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 </NUMEX>- a - share special dividend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year </TIMEX>. 
4698 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the bonanza with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders </ENAMEX>, because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases . 
4863 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>saw the payment as an effort also to dispel takeover speculation . 
4945 Whether a cash crunch might eventually force the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>to cut its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly </TIMEX>dividend , raised <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents </NUMEX>a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">only a year ago </TIMEX>, has become a topic of intense speculation on Wall Street since Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stookey </ENAMEX>deflected dividend questions in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 29 </TIMEX>meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>. 
5224 Some viewed his response - - that company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors </ENAMEX>review the dividend regularly - - as nothing more than the standard line from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>. 
5364 But others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual straight - from - the - shoulder performance . 
5477 In any case , on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day </TIMEX>of the meeting , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>' s shares slid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 625 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36 . 625 </NUMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>trading . 
5581 On top of everything else , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>confronts a disaster at its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Morris </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill .  
5666 After an explosion idled the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>progressed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>to within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours </TIMEX>of completing the drawn - out process of restarting it . 
5819 Then a second explosion occurred . 
5853 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>died and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six </NUMEX>remain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospital </ENAMEX>. 
5904 This human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>' s fortunes . 
6000 Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade - group safety awards . 
6118 A prolonged production halt at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>could introduce another imponderable into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>' s financial future . 
6229 When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant </ENAMEX>has just been running flat out to meet demand , calculating lost profit and thus claims under business - interruption insurance is straightforward . 
6387 But the numbers become trickier - - and subject to dickering between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">insured </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer </ENAMEX>- - when demand is shifting . 
6505 ` You say you could have sold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X percent </NUMEX>of this product and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y percent </NUMEX>of that , ' recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Semegran </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton </ENAMEX>who went through this exercise during his former career as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemical </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer </ENAMEX>. 
6728 ` And then you still have to negotiate . ' 
6770 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>hopes the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Morris </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>, where limited production got under way <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>, will resume full operation by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year ' s end </TIMEX>. 
6894 The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>usually accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 % to 25 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>' s polyethylene production and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX>of its ethylene production . 
7011 Not everything looks grim for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>. 
7050 The plant expansion should strengthen the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s sway in the polyethylene business , where market share is often taken through sheer capacity . 
7195 By lifting ethylene production , the expansion will also lower the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s raw material costs . 
7293 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>is also tightening its grip on its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business </ENAMEX>outside <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals </ENAMEX>, propane marketing . 
7393 Through a venture with its investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>an acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Petrolane Inc . </ENAMEX>in a transaction valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 18 billion </NUMEX>. 
7562 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Petrolane </ENAMEX>is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>- largest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">propane </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distributor </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
7626 The largest , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Suburban Propane </ENAMEX>, was already owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>. 
7689 Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>has a crisis to get past right now . 
7740 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suitor </ENAMEX>. 
7810 The name surfacing in rumors is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Petroleum Co . </ENAMEX>, which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
7932 Asked about a bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BP </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>says , ` We pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors , and I think that falls in that category .  

9 Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s highest - ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>saluted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s market plunge as an overdue comeuppance for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators </ENAMEX>and takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">players </ENAMEX>. 
154 Assuming that the market does n't head into a bottomless free fall , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>think <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s action could prove a harbinger of good news - - as a sign that the leveraged buy - out and takeover frenzy of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years </TIMEX>may be abating . 
388 ` This is a reaction to artificial LBO valuations , rather than to any fundamentals , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Young </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett - Packard Co . </ENAMEX>, whose shares dropped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 125 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 48 . 125 </NUMEX>. 
562 ` If we get rid of a lot of that nonsense , it will be a big plus . ' 
630 A few of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>here for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fall </TIMEX>meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Business Council </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>that meets to discuss national issues , were only too happy to personalize their criticism . 
804 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>wish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>would do something about leveraged buy - outs , do something about takeovers , do something about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump </ENAMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rand Araskog </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ITT Corp . </ENAMEX>, whose stock dropped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 375 </NUMEX>. 
1011 ` Where ' s the leadership ? 
1036 Where ' s the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy </ENAMEX>who can say : ` Enough is enough ' ' ? 
1088 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>were remarkably unperturbed by the plunge even though it lopped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars </NUMEX>off the value of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>- - and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions </NUMEX>off their personal fortunes . 
1267 ` I ' m not going to worry about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one day </TIMEX>' s decline , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Olsen </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>, who was leisurely strolling through the bright orange and yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves </ENAMEX>of the mountains here after his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s shares plunged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 75 </NUMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 86 . 50 </NUMEX>. 
1527 ` I did n't bother calling anybody ; I did n't even turn on TV . ' 
1590 ` There has n't been any fundamental change in the economy , ' added <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Smale </ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Procter &amp; Gamble Co . </ENAMEX>took an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 . 75 </NUMEX>slide to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 120 . 75 </NUMEX>. 
1735 ` The fact that this happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>and there was a recovery gives <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>some comfort that this wo n't be a problem . ' 
1862 Of course , established corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managements </ENAMEX>often tend to applaud the setbacks of stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators </ENAMEX>and takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists </ENAMEX>. 
1985 Indeed , one chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>who was downright delighted by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s events was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Crandall </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp . </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines </ENAMEX>and the target of a takeover offer by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump </ENAMEX>. 
2185 Asked whether <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s action could help him avoid being Trumped by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magnate </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall </ENAMEX>smiled broadly and said : ` No comment . ' 
2341 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning </TIMEX>, before the market ' s sell - off , the business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>issued a report predicting the economy would grow at roughly an inflation - adjusted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 % </NUMEX>annual rate , through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>, then accelerate anew in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991 </TIMEX>. 
2559 Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists </ENAMEX>who worked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Business Council </ENAMEX>forecast , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two </NUMEX>projected periods of decline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s output over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next two years </TIMEX>, and in ` both instances the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Preston </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J . P . Morgan &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice chairman </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Business Council </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Food and Drug Administration </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Nesbit </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency </ENAMEX>has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc . </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baltimore </ENAMEX>. 
216 Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vitarine </ENAMEX>nor any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Springfield Gardens </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . Y . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>have been charged with any crimes . 
343 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vitarine </ENAMEX>won approval to market a version of a blood pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">medicine </ENAMEX>but acknowledged that it substituted a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SmithKline Beecham PLC </ENAMEX>product as its own in tests . 
507 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nesbit </ENAMEX>also said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDA </ENAMEX>has asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bolar Pharmaceutical Co . </ENAMEX>to recall at the retail level its urinary tract <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">antibiotic </ENAMEX>. 
631 But so far the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>has n't complied with that request , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said . 
711 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bolar </ENAMEX>, the subject of a criminal investigation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDA </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Health and Human Services Department </ENAMEX>, only agreed to recall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>strengths of its version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Macrodantin </ENAMEX>` as far down as direct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>, mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">wholesalers </ENAMEX>, ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nesbit </ENAMEX>said . 
989 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bolar </ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Copiague </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . Y . </ENAMEX>, earlier began a voluntary recall of both its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">100 milligram </NUMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">50 milligram </NUMEX>versions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug </ENAMEX>. 
1115 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDA </ENAMEX>has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bolar </ENAMEX>substituted the brand - name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Macrodantin </ENAMEX>. 
1320 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bolar </ENAMEX>has denied that it switched the brand - name product for its own in such testing .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Robinson </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">57 years old </TIMEX>, was elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of magnetic recording heads for disk drives . 
148 He has been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amperex Electronics Corp . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">North American Philips Corp . </ENAMEX>, itself a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">N . V . Philips </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Netherlands </ENAMEX>. 
328 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles J . Lawson Jr . </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">68 </TIMEX>, who had been acting chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 14 </TIMEX>, will continue as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>. 
433 The former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric W . Markrud </ENAMEX>, resigned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June </TIMEX>.  

9 Measuring cups may soon be replaced by tablespoons in the laundry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room </ENAMEX>. 
83 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Procter &amp; Gamble Co . </ENAMEX>plans to begin testing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month </TIMEX>a superconcentrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent </ENAMEX>that will require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">only a few spoonfuls </NUMEX>per washload . 
223 The move stems from lessons learned in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>where local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>have had phenomenal success with concentrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">soapsuds </ENAMEX>. 
348 It also marks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P &amp; G </ENAMEX>' s growing concern that its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals </ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kao Corp . </ENAMEX>, may bring their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">superconcentrates </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
477 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cincinnati </ENAMEX>consumer - products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant </ENAMEX>got clobbered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kao </ENAMEX>introduced a powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent </ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Attack </ENAMEX>, which quickly won a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % </NUMEX>stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>markets . 
665 ` They do n't want to get caught again , ' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watcher </ENAMEX>. 
733 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Retailers </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz . </ENAMEX>, say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P &amp; G </ENAMEX>' s new powdered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent </ENAMEX>- - to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cheer with Color Guard </ENAMEX>- - will be on shelves in that market by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early November </TIMEX>. 
890 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P &amp; G </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman </ENAMEX>confirmed that shipments to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix </ENAMEX>started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last month </TIMEX>. 
969 She said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>will study results from this market before expanding to others . 
1056 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Superconcentrates </ENAMEX>are n't entirely new for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P &amp; G </ENAMEX>. 
1103 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>introduced a superconcentrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lemon Cheer </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>after watching the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Attack </ENAMEX>. 
1205 When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Attack </ENAMEX>hit the shelves in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P &amp; G </ENAMEX>' s share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>market fell to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 % </NUMEX>. 
1314 With the help of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lemon Cheer </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P &amp; G </ENAMEX>' s share is now estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 % </NUMEX>. 
1386 While the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P &amp; G </ENAMEX>will be in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>detergent market , where growth is slow and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">liquids </ENAMEX>have gained prominence over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">powders </ENAMEX>. 
1624 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>may have chosen to market the product under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cheer </ENAMEX>name since it ' s already expanded its best - selling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Tide </ENAMEX>into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 </NUMEX>different varieties , including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>' s big hit , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Tide with Bleach </ENAMEX>. 
1823 With <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">superconcentrates </ENAMEX>, however , it is n't always easy to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>that less is more ; many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>tend to dump too much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent </ENAMEX>into the washing machine , believing that it takes <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">a cup </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">powder </ENAMEX>to really clean the laundry . 
2059 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P &amp; G </ENAMEX>tried to launch here a concentrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent </ENAMEX>under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Ariel </ENAMEX>brand name that it markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>. 
2183 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">product </ENAMEX>, which was n't as concentrated as the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cheer </ENAMEX>, bombed in a market test in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>and was dropped . 
2300 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P &amp; G </ENAMEX>and others also have tried repeatedly to hook <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fabric softener </ENAMEX>combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience . 
2473 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P &amp; G </ENAMEX>contends the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cheer </ENAMEX>is a unique formula that also offers an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ingredient </ENAMEX>that prevents colors from fading . 
2589 And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers </ENAMEX>are expected to embrace the product , in part because it will take up less shelf space . 
2690 ` When shelf space was cheap , bigger was better , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Zurkuhlen </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Bros .  
2788 But with so many brands vying for space , that ' s no longer the case . 
2856 If the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cheer </ENAMEX>sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>follow with their own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">superconcentrates </ENAMEX>. 
3000 Then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers </ENAMEX>` will probably push the -LCB- less - established -RCB- brands out altogether , ' he says . 
3093 Competition is bound to get tougher if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kao </ENAMEX>introduces a product like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Attack </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
3181 To be sure , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kao </ENAMEX>would n't have an easy time taking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>market share away from the mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P &amp; G </ENAMEX>, which has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 23 % </NUMEX>of the market . 
3312 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kao </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>previously have said they are interested in selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergents </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>, but so far the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>has focused on acquisitions , such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>' s purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Andrew Jergens Co . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cincinnati </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">hand - lotion </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>. 
3538 It also has a product - testing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>. 
3594 Some believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P &amp; G </ENAMEX>' s interest in a superconcentrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent </ENAMEX>goes beyond the concern for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>. 
3697 ` This is something <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P &amp; G </ENAMEX>would do with or without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kao </ENAMEX>, ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zurkuhlen </ENAMEX>.  

9 While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought - induced peaks of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>, wheat prices remain stubbornly high . 
137 And they ' re likely to stay that way for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months </TIMEX>to come , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>say . 
209 For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>thing , even with many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers </ENAMEX>planting more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>say . 
379 And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Great Plains </ENAMEX>' wheat - growing areas , yields in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop </ENAMEX>now being planted could be reduced , further squeezing supplies . 
546 Also supporting prices are expectations that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union </ENAMEX>will place substantial buying orders over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few months </TIMEX>. 
673 By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next May 31 </TIMEX>, stocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat </ENAMEX>to be carried over into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next season </TIMEX>- - before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat </ENAMEX>now being planted is harvested - - are projected to drop to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">443 million bushels </NUMEX>. 
857 That would be the lowest level since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1970s </TIMEX>. 
911 Stocks were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">698 million bushels </NUMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 31 of this year </TIMEX>. 
969 In response to dwindling domestic supplies , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Agriculture </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clayton Yeutter </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>would slightly increase the number of acres <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers </ENAMEX>can plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat </ENAMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>and still qualify for federal support payments . 
1220 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>estimates that the new plan will boost production <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">about 66 million bushels </NUMEX>. 
1324 It now estimates production for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">just under 2 . 6 billion bushels </NUMEX>, compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>' s estimated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 . 04 billion </NUMEX>and a drought - stunted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 . 81 billion </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>. 
1496 But the full effect on prices of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat </ENAMEX>now being planted wo n't be felt until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second half of next year </TIMEX>. 
1614 Until then , limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 </NUMEX>- a - bushel level , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>say . 
1709 On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat </ENAMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December </TIMEX>delivery settled at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 0675 </NUMEX>a bushel , unchanged . 
1817 In theory at least , tight supplies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next spring </TIMEX>could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply - demand squeeze , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Basse </ENAMEX>, a futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AgResource Co . </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>. 
2010 Such a situation can wreak havoc , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer </TIMEX>on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade </ENAMEX>. 
2161 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CBOT </ENAMEX>ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferruzzi Finanziaria S . p . A . </ENAMEX>to liquidate futures positions equal to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">about 23 million bushels </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soybeans </ENAMEX>. 
2294 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange </ENAMEX>said it feared that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>would n't be able to find enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soybeans </ENAMEX>to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate </ENAMEX>, which had refused requests to reduce its holdings . 
2530 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferruzzi </ENAMEX>has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market . 
2608 Unseasonably hot , dry weather across large portions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Great Plains </ENAMEX>and in wheat - growing areas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oregon </ENAMEX>is threatening to reduce the yield from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this season </TIMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter </TIMEX>wheat <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop </ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conrad Leslie </ENAMEX>, a futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Leslie Analytical </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>. 
2885 For example , in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oklahoma </ENAMEX>panhandle , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 % </NUMEX>or more of the topsoil is short of moisture . 
2974 That figure climbs to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 47 % </NUMEX>in wheat - growing portions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kansas </ENAMEX>, he said . 
3054 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union </ENAMEX>has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>expect <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow </ENAMEX>to place sizable orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few months </TIMEX>, further supporting prices . 
3256 ` Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX>demand ' in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming weeks </TIMEX>, predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Feltes </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, research , for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Refco Inc . </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>. 
3414 Looking ahead to other commodity markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>: 
3468 Orange Juice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>will go . 
3583 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Late Thursday </TIMEX>, after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have been a bullish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . S . Department of Agriculture </ENAMEX>estimate of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 - 90 </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop </ENAMEX>. 
3762 It was near the low range of estimates , at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130 million </NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">90 - pound </NUMEX>boxes , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146 . 6 million </NUMEX>boxes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last season </TIMEX>. 
3882 However , as expected , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil </ENAMEX>waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 . 34 </NUMEX>a pound from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 1 . 55 </NUMEX>. 
4049 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>report might have had and sent the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November </TIMEX>orange juice contract down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as 6 . 55 cents </NUMEX>a pound at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>time . 
4255 It settled with a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 . 95 cents </NUMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 3210 </NUMEX>a pound . 
4314 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Brazilian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">juice </ENAMEX>, after a delay caused by drought at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the start of its crop season </TIMEX>, is beginning to arrive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>in large quantities . 
4452 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil </ENAMEX>wants to stimulate demand for its product , which is going to be in plentiful supply . 
4546 The price cut , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>said , appeared to be aimed even more at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>, where consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Brazilian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">juice </ENAMEX>has fallen . 
4670 It ' s a dollar - priced product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>said . 
4780 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>futures prices have dropped significantly from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 2 </NUMEX>a pound at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">midyear </TIMEX>. 
4869 Barring a cold snap or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop </ENAMEX>problems in the growing areas , downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January </TIMEX>, when harvesting and processing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">oranges </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>reach their peak , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>said . 
5089 Energy 
5098 Although some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>look for profit - taking in the wake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s leap in crude oil prices , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>' s rally is generally expected to continue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>. 
5259 ` I would continue to look for a stable crude market , at least in futures ' trading , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Hinton </ENAMEX>, an energy futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stotler &amp; Co .  
5409 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>capped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week </TIMEX>of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets . 
5500 On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Mercantile Exchange </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">West Texas Intermediate </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude </ENAMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November </TIMEX>delivery finished at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 . 89 </NUMEX>a barrel , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">42 cents </NUMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day </TIMEX>. 
5642 On <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX>markets , meanwhile , spot prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">North Sea </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crudes </ENAMEX>were up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents </NUMEX>a barrel . 
5741 ` This market still wants to go higher , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nauman Barakat </ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .  
5856 He predicted that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November </TIMEX>contract will reach <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21 . 50 </NUMEX>a barrel or more on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Mercantile Exchange </ENAMEX>. 
5970 There has been little news to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets . 
6046 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuels </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crudes </ENAMEX>. 
6182 There also are recurring reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union </ENAMEX>is having difficulties with its oil exports and that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nigeria </ENAMEX>has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell . 
6381 Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>foresee a tightening of near - term supplies , particularly of high - quality <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crudes </ENAMEX>such as those produced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">North Sea </ENAMEX>and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nigeria .   

9 On a recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night </TIMEX>, in the midst of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany </ENAMEX>' s most popular prime - time show , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contestant </ENAMEX>bet the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host </ENAMEX>that she could name any of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cheeses </ENAMEX>after just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>nibble , while blindfolded . 
217 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman </ENAMEX>won the bet . 
240 But perhaps even more remarkable , the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three - hour </TIMEX>- show , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Wetten Dass </ENAMEX>' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Make a Bet </ENAMEX>-RRB- , regularly wins the top slot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>' s TV ratings , sometimes drawing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as many as 50 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households </ENAMEX>. 
442 As the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992 </TIMEX>economic integration approaches , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>' s cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators </ENAMEX>have taken to the ramparts against <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>` cultural imperialism , ' threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Dallas </ENAMEX>, ' ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Miami Vice </ENAMEX>' and ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">L . A . Law </ENAMEX>. ' 
679 But much of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Europeans </ENAMEX>want to protect seems every bit as cheesy as what they are trying to keep out . 
791 The most militant opposition to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>TV imports has come from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French </ENAMEX>television and movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers </ENAMEX>, who have demanded quotas ensuring that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a full 60 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>' s TV shows be produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>. 
990 So far , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French </ENAMEX>have failed to win enough broad - based support to prevail . 
1069 A glance through the television listings and a few twists of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX>television dial suggest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>reason why . 
1183 While there are some popular action and drama series , few boast the high culture and classy production values one might expect . 
1311 More <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX>air time is filled with low - budget game shows , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">variety hours </TIMEX>, movies and talk shows , many of which are authorized knock - offs of their <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>counterparts . 
1484 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>' s most popular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night </TIMEX>programs features <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">semi - celebrities </ENAMEX>seeking out their grammar - school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates </ENAMEX>for on - air reunions . 
1628 A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Flemish </ENAMEX>game show has as its host a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Belgian </ENAMEX>pretending to be <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian </ENAMEX>. 
1700 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy </ENAMEX>' s favorite shows , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Fantastico </ENAMEX>, ' a tepid variety show , is so popular that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>clamored to buy a chocolate product , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cacao Fantastico </ENAMEX>, ' whose praises were sung <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">each week </TIMEX>by dancing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">showgirls </ENAMEX>- - even though the product did n't exist . 
1949 Topping the cheese stunt , on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">another typical evening </TIMEX>of fun on ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Wetten Dass </ENAMEX>, ' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contestant </ENAMEX>won a bet with the show ' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Gottschalk </ENAMEX>, that he could identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German </ENAMEX>dialects over the telephone . 
2154 A celebrity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Burt </ENAMEX>, also won a bet that someone could pile up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 </NUMEX>worth of quarters on a slanted coin . 
2303 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burt </ENAMEX>nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost , agreeing to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a day </TIMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreign Minister </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans - Dietrich Genscher </ENAMEX>frying and selling their combined weight in potato <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pancakes </ENAMEX>. 
2504 If this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the protectionist barriers , it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get . 
2659 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX>programs usually target only their own local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience </ENAMEX>, and often only a small portion of that . 
2763 Mega - hits in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy </ENAMEX>rarely make it even to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Great Britain </ENAMEX>, and almost never show up on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>screens . 
2885 Attempts to produce ` pan - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX>' programs have generally resulted in disappointment . 
2972 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>co - production , the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three - hour </TIMEX>- long ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Eurovision Song Contest </ENAMEX>, ' featuring soft - rock songs from each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>, has been described as the world ' s most boring TV show . 
3162 Another , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Jeux Sans Frontieres </ENAMEX>, ' where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers </ENAMEX>from assorted <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks , is a hit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>. 
3317 A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>- made imitation under the title ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Almost Anything Goes </ENAMEX>' flopped fast . 
3394 For the most part , what ' s made here stays here , and for good reason . 
3463 The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cream </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>crop , the literary dramas that are shown on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>public television as ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Masterpiece Theater </ENAMEX>, ' make up a relatively small part of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>air time . 
3634 Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>programming is more of an acquired taste . 
3689 There is , for instance , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">One Man and His Dog </ENAMEX>, ' a herding contest among sheep <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs </ENAMEX>. 
3772 Also riveting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>are <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours </TIMEX>of dart - throwing championships , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">even more hours </TIMEX>of lawn bowling contests and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">still more hours </TIMEX>of snooker marathons . 
3929 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX>drama has had better , though still mixed , fortunes . 
3990 The most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns . 
4053 A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French </ENAMEX>knock - off of ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Dallas </ENAMEX>, ' called ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Chateauvallon </ENAMEX>' and set in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">vineyard </ENAMEX>, had a good run in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>, which ended after the female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lead </ENAMEX>was injured in a real - life auto accident . 
4240 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Schwarzwaldklinik </ENAMEX>, ' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Black Forest Clinic </ENAMEX>-RRB- , a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German </ENAMEX>` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">St . Elsewhere </ENAMEX>' set in a health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">spa </ENAMEX>, is popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany </ENAMEX>, and has spread into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>. 
4391 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy </ENAMEX>' s most popular series is a drama called ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">La Piovra </ENAMEX>, ' or ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Octopus </ENAMEX>, ' which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Palermo </ENAMEX>against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Mafia </ENAMEX>. 
4561 It was front - page news in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year </TIMEX>when the fictional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector </ENAMEX>was gunned down in the series . 
4671 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain </ENAMEX>' s most popular mini - series <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>was ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Juncal </ENAMEX>, ' the story of an aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bullfighter </ENAMEX>. 
4765 ` The trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular , with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>programs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Wenham </ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of programs for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Broadcasting Corp .  
4965 ` Given a choice , everybody will watch a home - produced show . ' 
5028 But frequently there is n't much choice . 
5068 Thus , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own , programs with broader appeal . 
5181 ` We ' ve basically got to start from scratch , to train <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers </ENAMEX>to make shows that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>will want to see , ' concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Young </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">National Film Theatre School </ENAMEX>. 
5379 While some in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>contend that advertising is the bane of television , here many believe that its absence is to blame for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX>TV industry ' s sluggish development . 
5554 Until recently , national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising . 
5671 Since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication , as most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>programs are . 
5823 But not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged cheap - to - make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive - to - produce dramas . 
5987 Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>, and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly . 
6135 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just last week </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece </ENAMEX>authorized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">channels </ENAMEX>for the first time ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain </ENAMEX>earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">channels </ENAMEX>. 
6294 The result is a new and huge appetite for programming . 
6351 But perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas , most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available - - reruns - - usually of shows made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
6566 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sky Channel </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian - American </ENAMEX>press <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tycoon </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch </ENAMEX>, offers what must be a baffling cultural mix to most of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience </ENAMEX>. 
6724 The financially struggling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">station </ENAMEX>offers programs obviously made available cheaply from its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss </ENAMEX>' s other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures </ENAMEX>. 
6840 In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Madrid </ENAMEX>hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room </ENAMEX>recently , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer </ENAMEX>caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Great Barrier Reef </ENAMEX>, only to be urged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer </ENAMEX>to ` stay tuned for the further adventures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Skippy the Kangaroo </ENAMEX>.

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor Co . </ENAMEX>said it acquired <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % </NUMEX>of the shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar PLC </ENAMEX>.

551 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp . </ENAMEX>said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar </ENAMEX>before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford </ENAMEX>began buying shares . 
674 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>said it still is talking with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar </ENAMEX>about acquiring a minority interest .

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Nabisco Inc . </ENAMEX>is disbanding its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division </ENAMEX>responsible for buying network advertising time , just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a month </TIMEX>after moving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta </ENAMEX>. 
187 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>- based food and tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant </ENAMEX>, taken private <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year </TIMEX>in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 billion </NUMEX>leveraged buy - out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, confirmed that it is shutting down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Nabisco Broadcast </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>, and dismissing its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>, in a move to save money . 
472 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR </ENAMEX>is discussing its network - buying plans with its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>main advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">FCB \/ Leber Katz </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCann Erickson </ENAMEX>. 
609 ` We found with the size of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">media </ENAMEX>purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost , ' said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>, who declined to specify how much <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR </ENAMEX>spends on network television time . 
824 An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR </ENAMEX>is spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 140 million </NUMEX>on network television time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 200 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>. 
980 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said the broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>will be disbanded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec . 1 </TIMEX>, and the move wo n't affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR </ENAMEX>' s print , radio and spot - television buying practices . 
1129 The broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>had been based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago </TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR </ENAMEX>' s previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management </ENAMEX>moved it to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">headquarters </ENAMEX>before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer </TIMEX>. 
1293 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee </ENAMEX>with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR </ENAMEX>moved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>because ` there was supposed to be a future . ' 
1437 He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>hired <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two weeks </TIMEX>, wooing them from jobs with advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies </ENAMEX>. 
1572 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>moved the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>' upcoming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">season </TIMEX>. 
1755 ` The studies -LCB- on closing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>-RCB- could n't be completed until now , ' he said . 
1835 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Chrisanthopoulos </ENAMEX>, was n't in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>to comment .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf Resources &amp; Chemical Corp . </ENAMEX>said it agreed to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 5 million </NUMEX>as part of an accord with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Environmental Protection Agency </ENAMEX>regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">smelter </ENAMEX>the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>formerly operated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Idaho </ENAMEX>. 
236 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984 </TIMEX>the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EPA </ENAMEX>notified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf Resources </ENAMEX>, which was a part - owner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">smelter </ENAMEX>, that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Superfund </ENAMEX>program . 
422 The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">21 - square - mile </NUMEX>area is contaminated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">lead </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">zinc </ENAMEX>and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals </ENAMEX>. 
498 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf Resources </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year </TIMEX>proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Bermuda </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>, potentially exempting it from liability for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">smelter </ENAMEX>' s cleanup costs . 
683 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said that as part of its agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EPA </ENAMEX>, it ` made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization . ' 
868 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, which issued a statement on the agreement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday </TIMEX>, said that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million </NUMEX>of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 , 000 </NUMEX>will be recognized in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 third - quarter </TIMEX>statement . 
1102 The agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said . 
1186 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf Resources </ENAMEX>added that it ` will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Superfund </ENAMEX>law . ' 
1377 Under the agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf </ENAMEX>must give the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">45 days </TIMEX>' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock . 
1511 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s net worth can not fall below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 185 million </NUMEX>after the dividends are issued . 
1598 ` The terms of that agreement only become effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the date </TIMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf </ENAMEX>' s reorganization , which we anticipate will occur sometime in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1990 </TIMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence R . Mehl </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf </ENAMEX>' s general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel </ENAMEX>. 
1789 In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf </ENAMEX>must give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 days </TIMEX>' advance written notice of any loans exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million </NUMEX>that are made to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Bermuda </ENAMEX>- based holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
1951 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf </ENAMEX>' s net worth after those transaction must be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 150 million </NUMEX>. 
2023 Separately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it expects to hold a special meeting for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1990 </TIMEX>to vote on its proposed reorganization .  

9 Predicting the financial results of computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>has been a tough job lately . 
91 Take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft Corp . </ENAMEX>, the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether . 
210 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>stunned Wall Street with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>, a modest increase when compared with the sizzling expansion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years past </TIMEX>. 
429 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors </ENAMEX>- - taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the offing - - reacted by selling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s stock , which lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 25 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day </TIMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 52 </NUMEX>in national over - the - counter trading . 
635 But that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">all of three months ago </TIMEX>. 
675 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft </ENAMEX>said it expects revenue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its first quarter ended Sept . 30 </TIMEX>to increase <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 % </NUMEX>. 
774 The announcement caused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s stock to surge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 . 50 </NUMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 . 50 </NUMEX>a share . 
863 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft </ENAMEX>' s surprising strength is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>example of the difficulty facing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>. 
1020 ` It ' s hard to know what to expect at this point , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Rogers </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robertson Stephens &amp; Co .  
1128 ` The industry defies characterization . ' 
1170 To illustrate , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers </ENAMEX>said that of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 </NUMEX>computer - related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>he follows , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>will report for their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">most recent quarter </TIMEX>earnings below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>' s results , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>above those results . 
1366 Among those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>expected to have a down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">quarter </TIMEX>are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett - Packard Co . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amdahl Corp . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun Microsystems Inc . </ENAMEX>, generally solid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">performers </ENAMEX>in the past . 
1525 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp . </ENAMEX>also is expected to report disappointing results . 
1613 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer Inc . </ENAMEX>, meanwhile , is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept .  
1712 Another contradictory message comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Businessland Inc . </ENAMEX>, a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer </ENAMEX>. 
1793 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>reported that booming sales of new personal computers from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>had resulted in net income more than doubling for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its fourth quarter ended June 30 </TIMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 . 4 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
2010 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This month </TIMEX>, however , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Businessland </ENAMEX>warned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>that results for its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">first quarter ended Sept . 30 </TIMEX>had n't met expectations . 
2136 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it expects earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14 to 17 cents </NUMEX>a share , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents </NUMEX>a share in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier </TIMEX>period . 
2257 While the earnings picture confuses , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers </ENAMEX>say the major forces expected to shape the industry in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming year </TIMEX>are clearer . 
2390 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies </ENAMEX>will continue to war over standards . 
2437 In computer publishing , a battle over typefaces is hurting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe Systems Inc . </ENAMEX>, which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays . 
2596 Until recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe </ENAMEX>had a lock on the market for image software , but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe </ENAMEX>' s biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customer </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft </ENAMEX>rebelled . 
2735 Now the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>are collaborating on an alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe </ENAMEX>' s approach , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>say they are likely to carry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>, the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">seller </ENAMEX>of personal computers , along with them . 
2918 The short - term outlook for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe </ENAMEX>' s business , however , appears strong . 
2988 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>is beginning to ship a new software program that ' s being heralded as a boon for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners </ENAMEX>of low - end printers sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>. 
3122 The program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material . 
3189 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Warnock </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mountain View </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>has been receiving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 000 </NUMEX>calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several weeks ago </TIMEX>. 
3414 Meanwhile , competition between various operating systems , which control the basic functions of a computer , spells trouble for software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>generally . 
3566 ` It creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russ Crabs </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Soundview Financial Group </ENAMEX>. 
3681 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crabs </ENAMEX>said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aldus Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of a widely used computer publishing program . 
3818 He expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aldus </ENAMEX>to report earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21 cents </NUMEX>a share on revenues of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 . 5 million </NUMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its third quarter </TIMEX>, compared with earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 cents </NUMEX>a share on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 . 4 million </NUMEX>in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier </TIMEX>period . 
4024 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aldus </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>could n't be reached for comment . 
4075 On the other hand , the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant . 
4161 A bus is the data highway within a computer . 
4206 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>is backing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>type of bus called microchannel , while the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine </NUMEX>other leading computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">H - P </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq Computer Corp . </ENAMEX>, have chosen another method . 
4375 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users </ENAMEX>do n't care about the bus , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Benton </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co .  
4464 He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macintosh </ENAMEX>computers , for instance , uses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>different buses ` and no one seems to mind . ' 
4581 The gap between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">winners </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">laggards </ENAMEX>will grow . 
4629 In personal computers , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>are expected to tighten their hold on their business . 
4728 At the same time , <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>- tier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>will continue to lose ground . 
4796 Some lagging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>even may leave the personal computer business altogether . 
4879 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wyse Technology </ENAMEX>, for instance , is considered a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">candidate </ENAMEX>to sell its troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation </ENAMEX>. 
4968 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wyse </ENAMEX>has done well establishing a distribution business , but they have n't delivered products that sell , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimball Brown </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential - Bache Securities </ENAMEX>. 
5137 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown </ENAMEX>estimates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wyse </ENAMEX>, whose terminals business is strong , will report a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 cents </NUMEX>a share for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its quarter ended Sept </TIMEX>. 
5268 Personal - computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>. 
5371 Ever - more powerful desk - top computers , designed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>or more microprocessors as their ` brains , ' are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes . 
5580 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">guys </ENAMEX>that make traditional hardware are really being obsoleted by microprocessor - based machines , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benton </ENAMEX>. 
5702 As a result of this trend , longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">powerhouses </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">H - P </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp . </ENAMEX>are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor - based systems of their own . 
5867 But they will have to act quickly . 
5902 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benton </ENAMEX>expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>to unveil a family of high - end personal computers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this year </TIMEX>that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk - top machines . 
6104 A raft of new computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>also has targeted this ` server ' market .  

9 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus AG </ENAMEX>plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti - takeover defense of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Netherlands </ENAMEX>. 
170 The eventual court decision could become a landmark in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Dutch </ENAMEX>corporate law because the lawsuit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ASKO </ENAMEX>plans to file would be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>to challenge the entire principle and practice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>issuing voting preferred shares to management - controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholders </ENAMEX>. 
476 Up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged , though unsuccessfully , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ASKO </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Dutch </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers </ENAMEX>noted . 
601 Should the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts </ENAMEX>uphold the validity of this type of defense , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ASKO </ENAMEX>will then ask the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>to overturn such a vote - diluting maneuver recently deployed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Koninklijke Ahold NV </ENAMEX>. 
778 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ASKO </ENAMEX>says the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Dutch </ENAMEX>- based international food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer </ENAMEX>had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">trust </ENAMEX>and thus dilute the worth and voting power of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ASKO </ENAMEX>and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>. 
980 Speaking through its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Dutch </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ASKO </ENAMEX>also disclosed it holds a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % </NUMEX>stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ahold </ENAMEX>. 
1067 It was previously thought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ASKO </ENAMEX>held a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 . 6 % </NUMEX>stake that was accumulated since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>. 
1152 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ahold </ENAMEX>said his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred - share issue . 
1272 He termed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ASKO </ENAMEX>' s legal actions as ` unproductive ' to international cooperation among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers </ENAMEX>.  

9 The official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House </ENAMEX>reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">60 - year </TIMEX>history of calm , right up through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
129 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady </ENAMEX>said in a statement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>that the stock - market decline ` does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy . ' 
295 ` The economy , ' he added , ` remains well - balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . ' 
396 Sound familiar ? 
412 Here ' s what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan </ENAMEX>said after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash : ` The underlying economy remains sound . 
504 There is nothing wrong with the economy . . . all the indices are up . ' 
577 Heard that before ? 
596 After the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1929 </TIMEX>crash , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Hoover </ENAMEX>said : ` The fundamental business of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>. . . is on a sound and prosperous basis .  

9 With economic tension between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>worsening , many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>had feared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>' s visit from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Trade Representative </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla Hills </ENAMEX>. 
156 They expected a new barrage of demands that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
271 Instead , they got a discussion of the need for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>to work together and of the importance of the long - term view . 
399 Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills </ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America </ENAMEX>' s chief trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiator </ENAMEX>had a completely different tone from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>' s visit by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A . Mosbacher </ENAMEX>. 
568 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosbacher </ENAMEX>called for concrete results by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next spring </TIMEX>in negotiations over fundamental <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade . 
722 He said such results should be ` measurable in dollars and cents ' in reducing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>trade deficit with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>. 
836 But Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills </ENAMEX>, speaking at a breakfast meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">American Chamber of Commerce </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday </TIMEX>, stressed that the objective ` is not to get definitive action by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">spring </TIMEX>or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer </TIMEX>, it is rather to have a blueprint for action . ' 
1070 She added that she expected ` perhaps to have a down payment . . . some small step to convince the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>that we ' re moving in earnest . ' 
1241 How such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months </TIMEX>. 
1311 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosbacher </ENAMEX>and Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills </ENAMEX>. 
1436 Many called it simply a contrast in styles . 
1480 But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic . 
1529 Others said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>may feel the rhetoric on both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">sides </ENAMEX>is getting out of hand . 
1625 And some said it reflected the growing debate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>over pursuing free trade with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>versus some kind of managed trade . 
1758 Asked to compare her visit to Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosbacher </ENAMEX>' s , Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills </ENAMEX>replied : ` I did n't hear every word he spoke , but as a general proposition , I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>. ' 
1969 Yet <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>who sat in with her during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three days </TIMEX>of talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>said her tone often was surprisingly ` conciliatory . ' 
2131 ` I think my line has been very consistent , ' Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills </ENAMEX>said at a news conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>. 
2232 ` I am painted sometimes as ferocious , perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement . 
2336 I do n't feel very ferocious . 
2365 I do n't feel either hard or soft . 
2399 I feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade . ' 
2474 When she met the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press </ENAMEX>for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>time on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills </ENAMEX>firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products , satellites and supercomputers , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>areas targeted under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Super 301 </ENAMEX>provision of the 1988 trade bill . 
2740 She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>has identified . 
2829 But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world - wide free trade and open competition . 
2926 She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and should n't be tackled by setting quantitative targets . 
3055 At her news conference for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>economics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist </ENAMEX>summed up the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>sense of relief . 
3167 ` My impression was that you would be a scary old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady </ENAMEX>, ' he said , drawing a few nervous chuckles from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues </ENAMEX>. 
3284 ` But I am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person </ENAMEX>of integrity . ' 
3390 Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills </ENAMEX>' remarks did raise questions , at least among some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>, about what exactly her stance is on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>semiconductor market . 
3553 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>market has been stuck around <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years </TIMEX>. 
3628 Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans </ENAMEX>have interpreted a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>agreement as assuring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 % </NUMEX>share by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991 </TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>have denied making any such promise . 
3781 At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of her news conferences , Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills </ENAMEX>said , ` I believe we can do much better than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 % </NUMEX>. ' 
3874 But she stressed , ` I am against managed trade . 
3921 I will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market .  

9 If a hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">predator </ENAMEX>emerges for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co - founders </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Saatchi </ENAMEX>will lead a management buy - out attempt , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said . 
187 Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s stock - market sell - off in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>and turmoil in the junk - bond market . 
336 But the beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>advertising and consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant </ENAMEX>, which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>named a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Saatchi </ENAMEX>, has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks </TIMEX>. 
544 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi </ENAMEX>' s largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shareholder </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southeastern Asset Management </ENAMEX>, said it had been approached by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>or more <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">parties </ENAMEX>interested in a possible restructuring . 
714 And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Spielvogel </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi </ENAMEX>' s big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel Bates </ENAMEX>advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>, said he had offered to lead a management buy - out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, but was rebuffed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Saatchi </ENAMEX>. 
920 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielvogel </ENAMEX>said he would n't launch a hostile bid . 
976 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi </ENAMEX>said that ` if a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bidder </ENAMEX>came up with a ludicrously high offer , a crazy offer which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi </ENAMEX>knew it could n't beat , it would have no choice but to recommend it to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>. 
1191 But -LCB- otherwise -RCB- it would undoubtedly come back ' with an offer by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management </ENAMEX>. 
1268 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>said any buy - out would be led by the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Saatchi </ENAMEX>and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Saatchi </ENAMEX>. 
1437 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielvogel </ENAMEX>is n't part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>, nor are any of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi </ENAMEX>' s big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>- based ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies </ENAMEX>. 
1551 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>did n't name any price , but securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>have said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi </ENAMEX>would fetch upward of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 3 billion </NUMEX>. 
1668 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>denied speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi </ENAMEX>was bringing in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>only to clean up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>financially so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers </ENAMEX>could lead a buy - back . 
1847 That speculation abounded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>as industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>analyzed the appointment of the new chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Louis - Dreyfus </ENAMEX>, who joins <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi </ENAMEX>and becomes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member </ENAMEX>of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan . 1 </TIMEX>. 
2041 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis - Dreyfus </ENAMEX>, formerly chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>of the pharmaceutical research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IMS International Inc . </ENAMEX>, has a reputation as a savvy financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>, and will be charged largely with repairing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi </ENAMEX>' s poor financial state . 
2269 Asked about the speculation that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis - Dreyfus </ENAMEX>has been hired to pave the way for a buy - out by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers </ENAMEX>, the executive replied , ` That is n't the reason <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dreyfus </ENAMEX>has been brought in . 
2457 He was brought in to turn around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. ' 
2506 Separately , several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi </ENAMEX>agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients </ENAMEX>said they believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s management shakeup will have little affect on them . 
2635 ` It has n't had any impact on us , nor do we expect it to , ' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Miller Brewing Co . </ENAMEX>, a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel </ENAMEX>. 
2773 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lampe </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of advertising at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client </ENAMEX>, said : ` We have no problem with the announcement , because we do n't know what change it ' s going to bring about . 
2980 We are n't going to change <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies </ENAMEX>because of a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>. ' 
3049 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executives </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel </ENAMEX>client <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avis Inc . </ENAMEX>, as well as at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi </ENAMEX>client <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philips Lighting Co . </ENAMEX>, also said they saw no effect . 
3180 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executives </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential - Bache Securities Inc . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client </ENAMEX>that is reviewing its account , declined comment . 
3304 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielvogel </ENAMEX>had said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential - Bache </ENAMEX>was prepared to finance either a management buy - out and restructuring , or a buy - out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel </ENAMEX>alone , led by him .

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust Savings Bank </ENAMEX>said federal thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators </ENAMEX>ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>classes of preferred stock , indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators </ENAMEX>' concerns about the troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution </ENAMEX>have heightened . 
228 In a statement , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators </ENAMEX>cited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>' s operating losses and ` apparent losses ' in its junk - bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends . 
415 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Regulators </ENAMEX>also ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>to stop buying back the preferred stock . 
491 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David L .

692 He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>will try to get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators </ENAMEX>to reverse the decision . 
765 The suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators </ENAMEX>have deep concerns about an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution </ENAMEX>' s health . 
909 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators </ENAMEX>labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>a ` troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution </ENAMEX>, ' largely because of its big junk - bond holdings and its operating losses .

1330 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>, which is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>' s largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>, holds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of the largest junk - bond portfolios of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>. 
1450 Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April </TIMEX>, it has pared its high - yield bond holdings to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 890 million </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 35 billion </NUMEX>. 
1547 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>said <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only about $ 150 million </NUMEX>of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission </ENAMEX>. 
1690 The remainder , he said , are commercial loan participations , or private placements , that are n't filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC </ENAMEX>and do n't have a ready market . 
1837 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators </ENAMEX>have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds . 
1927 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of Thrift Supervision </ENAMEX>has been hounding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>to provide current market values for its holdings , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market . 
2174 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Regulators </ENAMEX>have become increasingly antsy about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust ' s </ENAMEX>and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts </ENAMEX>' junk - bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk - bond market . 
2382 The legislation requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts </ENAMEX>to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new , somber regulatory climate . 
2491 In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>composite trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>common shares closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 . 5 cents </NUMEX>. 
2600 In a statement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>challenged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators </ENAMEX>' decision , saying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>' s operating losses and ` apparent ' junk - bond losses ` have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>. ' 
2813 He also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds . 
2908 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, for instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>added <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 22 . 5 million </NUMEX>to its general reserves . 
3000 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators </ENAMEX>should instead move ahead with approving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>' s request to sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 </NUMEX>of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Western Bank </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Western Financial Corp . </ENAMEX>based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .  
3215 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch </ENAMEX>sale is the centerpiece of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>' s strategy to transform itself into a traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S &amp; L </ENAMEX>from a high - flying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution </ENAMEX>that relied heavily on securities trading for profits , according to Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>. 
3425 Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>and thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>had expected a decision on the proposed transaction , which was announced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>, long before now . 
3560 Many interpret the delay as an indication that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators </ENAMEX>are skeptical about the proposal . 
3652 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Branches </ENAMEX>and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators </ENAMEX>take over an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution </ENAMEX>. 
3759 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>, however , touts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch </ENAMEX>sale , saying it would bring in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million </NUMEX>and reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>' s assets to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 . 7 billion </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 billion </NUMEX>. 
3903 It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 82 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1 . 2 % </NUMEX>of assets , from a negative <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33 million </NUMEX>as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 30 </TIMEX>, thus bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>close to regulatory standards . 
4101 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch </ENAMEX>sale would also reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s large amount of good will by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 180 million </NUMEX>. 
4212 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics </ENAMEX>, however , say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch </ENAMEX>sale will make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds . 
4333 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul </ENAMEX>counters that he intends to further pare the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust </ENAMEX>by not renewing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 billion </NUMEX>of brokered certificates of deposit when they come due . 
4497 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>is also working to unload its junk - bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds , and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliate </ENAMEX>, as required under the new thrift law .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors </ENAMEX>who bought stock with borrowed money - - that is , ` on margin ' - - may be more worried than most following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s market drop . 
147 That ' s because their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers </ENAMEX>can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans . 
280 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>, these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market . 
395 Typically , a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 % </NUMEX>of its original value . 
492 If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX>does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call , the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>may begin liquidating the securities . 
618 But some big brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls . 
714 Margin calls since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>` have been higher than usual , but reasonable , ' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </ENAMEX>said . 
839 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>` do n't expect -LCB- margin calls -RCB- to be as big a factor as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>' because fewer individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>are buying stock on margin , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said . 
1015 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo Quackenbush </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Charles Schwab Corp . </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX>- based discount brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schwab </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>. 
1214 He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schwab </ENAMEX>had increased margin requirements ` so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>have more of a cushion . ' 
1302 He added : ` We learned a lesson in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>about volatility .  

9 Call it the ` we ' re too broke to fight ' defense . 
59 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers </ENAMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens </NUMEX>of insolvent savings and loan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">associations </ENAMEX>are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creditors </ENAMEX>. 
224 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers </ENAMEX>claim that the suits , numbering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700 to 1 , 000 </NUMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>alone , should be dismissed as moot because neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S &amp; Ls </ENAMEX>nor the extinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp . </ENAMEX>has the money to pay judgments . 
450 Though the argument may have a common - sense ring to it , even the S &amp; L <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers </ENAMEX>concede there ' s little precedent to back their position . 
586 Still , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>federal appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>has signaled it ' s willing to entertain the notion , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers </ENAMEX>have renewed their arguments in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight </NUMEX>other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>where the defense is permitted under state law . 
797 The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>and reducing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FSLIC </ENAMEX>' s massive legal bills , which topped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 73 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>. 
975 The S &amp; L <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers </ENAMEX>were encouraged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>by an appellate - court ruling in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>cases brought against defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt Savings &amp; Loan Association </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas </ENAMEX>by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developers </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Valley Ranch </ENAMEX>, best known as the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">center </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Dallas Cowboys </ENAMEX>football <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team </ENAMEX>. 
1240 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt </ENAMEX>foreclosed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">ranch </ENAMEX>. 
1275 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FSLIC </ENAMEX>argued to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fifth U . S . Circuit Court of Appeals </ENAMEX>` that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt Savings </ENAMEX>nor any means to collect from any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">party </ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FSLIC </ENAMEX>. ' 
1508 ` If true , ' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>wrote , ` this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds . ' 
1618 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>said it lacked enough financial information about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FSLIC </ENAMEX>and sent the cases back to federal district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas </ENAMEX>. 
1767 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Haworth </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt </ENAMEX>, says he plans to file a brief <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>urging the district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge </ENAMEX>to dismiss the suits , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt </ENAMEX>' s liabilities exceeded its assets by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 billion </NUMEX>when federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>closed it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 1988 </TIMEX>. 
2016 ` This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution </ENAMEX>is just brain dead , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haworth </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Andrews &amp; Kurth </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>. 
2146 But a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Triland Investment Group </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developer </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Valley Ranch </ENAMEX>, dismisses such arguments as a ` defense du jour . ' 
2269 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Jackson </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas </ENAMEX>says a judgment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Triland </ENAMEX>could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award , including the reversal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt </ENAMEX>' s foreclosure on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Valley Ranch </ENAMEX>. 
2455 ` We ' re asking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory , ' he says . 
2563 ` We ' d take the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Valley Ranch </ENAMEX>free and clear as a booby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">prize </ENAMEX>.  

9 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>plans to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 175 million </NUMEX>in new cash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday </TIMEX>by selling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 9 . 75 billion </NUMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">52 - week </TIMEX>bills and redeeming <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 . 58 billion </NUMEX>of maturing bills . 
168 The bills will be dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 26 </TIMEX>and will mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 25 , 1990 </TIMEX>. 
231 They will be available in minimum denominations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 , 000 </NUMEX>. 
293 Bids must be received by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 p . m . EDT </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday </TIMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>or at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches </ENAMEX>.  

9 The crowded field for notebook - sized computers is about to become a lot more crowded . 
97 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq Computer Corp . </ENAMEX>' s long - awaited entry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith Electronics Corp . </ENAMEX>, the current market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">leader </ENAMEX>, and on a swarm of promising start - ups . 
335 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>' s series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market . 
431 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer </ENAMEX>already has produced a clipboard - sized computer called a notepad , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>others have introduced even smaller ` palmtops . ' 
572 But those machines are still considered novelties , with keyboards only a munchkin could love and screens to match . 
687 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>' s notebooks , by contrast , may be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines . 
815 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>say they ' re faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market - - and they ' re priced aggressively at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 , 400 to $ 5 , 000 </NUMEX>. 
968 All of this comes in a machine that weighs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">only six pounds </NUMEX>and fits comfortably into most briefcases . 
1072 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>' s competition , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy Corp . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC Corp . </ENAMEX>all have introduced portables that weigh approximately the same and that are called notebooks - - perhaps misleadingly . 
1290 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>, noting that most such machines are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">about two inches </NUMEX>thick , takes exception to the name . 
1391 ` This is n't quite a notebook - - I call it a phonebook , ' he says . 
1458 That ca n't be said of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 , 400 </NUMEX>notepad computer introduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few weeks ago </TIMEX>by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GRiD Systems Corp . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy </ENAMEX>. 
1575 Instead of a keyboard , it features a writing surface , an electronic pen and the ability to ` read ' block printing . 
1689 At <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">4 1 \/ 2 pounds </NUMEX>, it may be too ambitiously named , but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>froth . 
1832 Palmtops are n't far behind . 
1860 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atari Corp . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Portfolio </ENAMEX>, introduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two months ago </TIMEX>and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>in early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>, weighs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">less than a pound </NUMEX>, costs a mere <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 </NUMEX>and runs on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>AA batteries , yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs . 
2107 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics </ENAMEX>, however , say its ability to run commonplace programs is restricted by a limited memory . 
2211 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Poquet Computer Corp . </ENAMEX>, meanwhile , has introduced a much more sophisticated palmtop that can run <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 </ENAMEX>and other sophisticated software programs , but costs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>times as much . 
2394 At stake is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Swavely </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">North America </ENAMEX>operations , calls ` the Holy Grail of the computer industry ' - - the search for ` a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere . ' 
2607 The market is so new , nobody knows yet how big it can be . 
2665 ` I ' ve had a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>trying to sell me services to find out how big it is , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Humphries </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of marketing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GRiD </ENAMEX>. 
2798 ` Whether it ' s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion </NUMEX>or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 5 billion </NUMEX>, it does n't matter . 
2859 It ' s huge . ' 
2873 Consider the growth of portables , which now comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 % </NUMEX>of all personal computer sales . 
2962 Laptops - - generally anything under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 </NUMEX>pounds - - have become the fastest - growing personal computer segment , with sales doubling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
3103 Responding to that demand , however , has led to a variety of compromises . 
3176 Making computers smaller often means sacrificing memory . 
3233 It also has precluded use of the faster , more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines . 
3353 Size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays . 
3421 The competitive sniping can get pretty petty at times . 
3476 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Poquet </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>, for example , criticizes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atari </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Portfolio </ENAMEX>because it requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>batteries while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Poquet </ENAMEX>needs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two </NUMEX>. 
3609 Both palmtops are dismissed by notebook <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>, who argue that they ' re too small - - a problem <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Poquet </ENAMEX>also encountered in focus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups </ENAMEX>, admits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerry Purdy </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of marketing . 
3787 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Poquet </ENAMEX>, trying to avoid the ` gadget ' label , responded with the tag line , ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Poquet </ENAMEX>PC - - a Very Big Computer . ' 
3902 Despite the sniping , few question the inevitability of the move to small machines that do n't make compromises . 
4013 Toward that end , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts </ENAMEX>say the real battle will take place between center - stage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players </ENAMEX>like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith </ENAMEX>and now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>. 
4142 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>' s new machines are considered a direct threat to start - up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dynabook Inc . </ENAMEX>, which introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June </TIMEX>a computer that , like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>' s , uses an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">286 </ENAMEX>microprocessor and has a hard disk drive . 
4350 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dynabook </ENAMEX>product is twice as heavy and costs more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>' s . 
4425 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>' s announcement also spells trouble for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith </ENAMEX>, which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cie . des Machines Bull </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>- owned computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>. 
4650 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders </ENAMEX>will vote in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December </TIMEX>on the proposed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 635 million </NUMEX>sale , a price that could slip because it is pegged to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith </ENAMEX>' s share and sales . 
4798 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>is already taking aim at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith </ENAMEX>' s market share . 
4853 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rod Canion </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>, notes pointedly that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">MinisPort </ENAMEX>uses an ` unconventional ' <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">two - inch </NUMEX>floppy disk , whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>' s new machines use the more common <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">3 1 \/ 2 - inch </NUMEX>disk . 
5074 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John P . Frank </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith Data Systems </ENAMEX>, simply shrugs off such criticism , noting that <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">3 1 \/ 2 - inch </NUMEX>floppies were also ` unconventional ' when they first replaced <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">five - inch </NUMEX>disks . 
5258 ` We do n't look at it as not being a standard , we look at it as a new standard , ' he argues . 
5351 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>do n't see it that way . 
5383 ` I ca n't imagine that you ' ll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is dynamite for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>and a stopper for everyone else , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Talsky </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Professional Marketing Management Inc .  
5578 Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Lempesis </ENAMEX>, senior industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DataQuest </ENAMEX>, a high - technology market research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>: ` We basically think that these are very hot products . 
5731 The problem <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them . ' 
5821 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>' s machines include the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">3 1 \/ 2 - inch </NUMEX>floppy disk drive , a backlit screen that is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">only 1 \/ 4 - inch </NUMEX>thick and an internal expansion slot for a modem - - in other words , almost all the capabilities of a typical office machine . 
6047 Others undoubtedly will follow , but most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>has at least a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six - month </TIMEX>lead on the competition . 
6162 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba </ENAMEX>' s line of portables , for example , features the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">T - 1000 </ENAMEX>, which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">T - 1600 </ENAMEX>, which also uses a 286 microprocessor , but which weighs almost twice as much and is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>times the size . 
6420 A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX>model , marketed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>, may hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the first quarter of 1990 </TIMEX>, but by then , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>say , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq </ENAMEX>will have established itself as one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players </ENAMEX>. 
6608 What about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Blue </ENAMEX>? 
6629 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>say , has been burned twice in trying to enter the laptop market and shows no signs of trying to get into notebooks anytime soon .  

9 The oil industry ' s middling profits could persist through the rest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year </TIMEX>. 
91 Major oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few days </TIMEX>are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter a year ago </TIMEX>, largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . 
306 The gasoline picture may improve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this quarter </TIMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals </ENAMEX>are likely to remain weak , industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>say , reducing chances that profits could equal their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier </TIMEX>performance . 
508 The industry is ` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">petrochemicals </ENAMEX>, ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Cox </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips Petroleum Co . </ENAMEX>, said in an interview . 
676 ` That change will obviously impact <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third and fourth quarter </TIMEX>earnings ' for the industry in general , he added . 
785 He did n't forecast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips </ENAMEX>' s results . 
826 But securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips </ENAMEX>will be among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>hard - hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>earnings . 
981 So , too , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>predict , will <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevron Corp . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amoco Corp .  
1063 Typical is what happened to the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">ethylene </ENAMEX>, a major commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemical </ENAMEX>produced in vast amounts by many oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>. 
1189 It has plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 % </NUMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 26 cents </NUMEX>a pound . 
1247 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year ago </TIMEX>ethylene sold for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33 cents </NUMEX>, peaking at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 34 cents </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last December </TIMEX>. 
1329 A big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion . 
1391 Beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid - 1987 </TIMEX>, prices began accelerating as a growing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>economy and the weak dollar spurred demand . 
1502 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies </ENAMEX>added capacity furiously . 
1538 Now , greatly increased supplies are on the market , while the dollar is stronger , and domestic economic growth is slower . 
1661 Third - quarter profits from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasoline </ENAMEX>were weaker . 
1710 ` Refining margins were so good in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter of last year </TIMEX>and generally not very good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Randol </ENAMEX>, a securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp .  
1881 Oil company <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refineries </ENAMEX>ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>that did n't materialize . 
2008 The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period . 
2070 In addition , crude oil prices were up some from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>, further pressuring profitability . 
2170 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Refiners </ENAMEX>say margins picked up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>, and many industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>believe gasoline profits will rebound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this quarter </TIMEX>, though still not to the level of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 ' s fourth quarter </TIMEX>. 
2351 During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 second half </TIMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>posted record gasoline and chemical profits . 
2442 Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>' earnings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
2544 Prices - - averaging roughly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 </NUMEX>a barrel higher in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>- - have stayed well above most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>' expectations . 
2688 Demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically accelerates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter </TIMEX>. 
2788 ` We could see higher oil prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryan Jacoboski </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc .  
2887 That will translate into sharply higher production profits , particularly compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>when oil prices steadily fell to below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13 </NUMEX>a barrel in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter </TIMEX>. 
3061 While oil prices have been better than expected , natural gas prices have been worse . 
3146 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, they averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 % </NUMEX>less than they were in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>. 
3220 The main reason remains weather . 
3253 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last summer </TIMEX>was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities </ENAMEX>to burn more natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas </ENAMEX>to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use . 
3415 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This summer </TIMEX>, on the other hand , had milder weather than usual . 
3480 ` We ' ve been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>. 
3589 ` The lagging gas price is not going to assist <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth quarter </TIMEX>performance as many had expected . ' 
3687 Going into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter </TIMEX>, natural gas prices are anywhere from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 % to 17 % </NUMEX>lower than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
3792 For instance , natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas </ENAMEX>currently produced along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Gulf Coast </ENAMEX>is selling on the spot market for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 1 . 47 </NUMEX>a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">thousand cubic feet </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 69 </NUMEX>a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">thousand cubic feet </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago </TIMEX>.

99 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s edition , the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>was misstated .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weatherford International Inc . </ENAMEX>said it canceled plans for a preferred - stock swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock , and added that it expects to publicly offer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10 million </NUMEX>common shares . 
218 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it planned to offer an undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">585 , 000 </NUMEX>shares of its preferred stock outstanding . 
366 The exchange ratio was never established . 
408 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weatherford </ENAMEX>said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange . 
494 The energy - services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>said , however , that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1990 </TIMEX>, it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock . 
619 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weatherford </ENAMEX>suspended its preferred - dividend payment in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1985 </TIMEX>and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 6 million </NUMEX>, but will do so some time in the future . 
813 Additionally , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission </ENAMEX>for the proposed offering of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million </NUMEX>shares of common stock , expected to be offered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November </TIMEX>.

1215 Proceeds will be used to eliminate and restructure bank debt . 
1277 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weatherford </ENAMEX>currently has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 11 . 1 million </NUMEX>common shares outstanding .

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>, in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers </ENAMEX>, is lowering its circulation guarantee to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second consecutive year </TIMEX>, increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways . 
246 In an announcement to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner Inc . </ENAMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX>will ` dramatically de - emphasize ' its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives ; cut the circulation it guarantees <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers </ENAMEX>by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300 , 000 </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four million </NUMEX>; and increase the cost of its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>subscription rate by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 4 to $ 55 </NUMEX>. 
619 In a related development , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">news - weekly </ENAMEX>, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">the fourth year </TIMEX>in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>; a full , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>- color page in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 120 , 000 </NUMEX>. 
808 However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 5 % </NUMEX>higher per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber </ENAMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Heinemann </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX>associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher </ENAMEX>. 
992 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX>is following the course of some other mass - circulation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines </ENAMEX>that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years </TIMEX>have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">advertisers </ENAMEX>. 
1215 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reader ' s Digest </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times Co . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCall ' s </ENAMEX>, and most recently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">News Corp . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TV Guide </ENAMEX>, have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">advertisers </ENAMEX>. 
1442 Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers </ENAMEX>in the hyper - competitive world of magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">news - weeklies </ENAMEX>. 
1633 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX>, as part of the more cost - conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner </ENAMEX>, wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks . 
1742 Besides , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>think selling a news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>with a clock radio is tacky . 
1826 ` Giveaways just give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>the wrong image , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinemann </ENAMEX>. 
1892 ` That perception takes the focus off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>. ' 
1946 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX>magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">advertisers </ENAMEX>. 
2070 ` What we are doing is screening out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers </ENAMEX>who are only casually related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>and do n't really read it , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinemann </ENAMEX>. 
2211 ` We are trying to create quality and involvement . ' 
2264 However , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>used the same explanation when in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1988 </TIMEX>the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>cut its guaranteed circulation from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 . 6 million </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 . 3 million </NUMEX>. 
2413 And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX>' s paid circulation , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Audit Bureau of Circulations </ENAMEX>, dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 3 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 , 393 , 237 </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the six months ended June 30 , 1989 </TIMEX>. 
2552 Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX>' s move is being received well , once again . 
2607 ` It ' s terrific for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">advertisers </ENAMEX>to know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader </ENAMEX>will be paying more , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Drexler </ENAMEX>, national media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bozell Inc . </ENAMEX>ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency </ENAMEX>. 
2751 ` A few drops in circulation are of no consequence . 
2802 It ' s not a show of weakness ; they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits . ' 
2910 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinemann </ENAMEX>said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry : a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>' s net revenue per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber </ENAMEX>, or the actual revenue from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers </ENAMEX>after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away . 
3135 ` The question is how much are we getting from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader </ENAMEX>, ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinemann </ENAMEX>. 
3217 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX>' s rivals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">news - weeklies </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Washington Post Co . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newsweek </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U . S . News &amp; World Report </ENAMEX>, are less reliant on electronic giveaways , and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years </TIMEX>both have been increasing their circulation rate bases . 
3426 Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines </ENAMEX>are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a month </TIMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inland Steel Industries Inc . </ENAMEX>expects to report that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>earnings dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous quarter </TIMEX>as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs . 
191 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmaker </ENAMEX>had net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45 . 3 million </NUMEX>or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 25 </NUMEX>a share , including a pretax charge of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 million </NUMEX>related to the settlement of a suit , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 11 billion </NUMEX>. 
386 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">200 , 000 tons </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter </TIMEX>, compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter </TIMEX>. 
569 At the same time , the integrated - steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses , as well as higher labor costs under its new contract . 
759 The service - center business was hurt by reduced margins and start - up costs associated with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Joseph T . Ryerson &amp; Son </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>. 
886 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it is beginning to see some shipping - rate improvements in both the intergrated - steel and steel - service - center segments , which should result in improved results for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter </TIMEX>. 
1089 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inland </ENAMEX>said its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>results will be announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this week </TIMEX>. 
1162 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year - earlier third quarter </TIMEX>, when the industry was in the midst of a boom , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>had net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 61 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 70 </NUMEX>a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 02 billion </NUMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Seelenfreund </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">52 years old </TIMEX>, was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">processor </ENAMEX>of prescription claims , succeeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas W . Field Jr . </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">55 </TIMEX>, who resigned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>. 
164 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field </ENAMEX>also had been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McKesson Corp . </ENAMEX>, resigning that post after a dispute with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>over corporate strategy . 
292 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seelenfreund </ENAMEX>is executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McKesson </ENAMEX>and will continue in those roles . 
411 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PCS </ENAMEX>also named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rex R . Malson </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">57 </TIMEX>, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McKesson </ENAMEX>, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>, filling the seat vacated by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field </ENAMEX>. 
537 Messrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malson </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seelenfreund </ENAMEX>are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McKesson </ENAMEX>, which has an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86 % </NUMEX>stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PCS </ENAMEX>.  

9 Do n't jump yet . 
25 The stock market ' s swoon may turn out to be good news for the economy . 
98 In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one wild hour </TIMEX>of trading , the market managed to accomplish what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>has been trying to do , unsuccessfully , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks </TIMEX>. 
239 It is forcing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve </ENAMEX>to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar . 
363 The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>business - - indeed , the entire economy . 
501 This may sound strangely optimistic . 
538 After all , until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few years ago </TIMEX>, the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy . 
640 When it went down , by all tradition , the economy followed . 
701 That has changed , partly because the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years </TIMEX>following the worst stock - market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable . 
833 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash was ` a false alarm however you view it , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Chicago </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Zarnowitz </ENAMEX>. 
946 The market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>. 
1018 Its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy . 
1140 ` The market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>has a life of its own , ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Akers </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp . </ENAMEX>, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday </TIMEX>. 
1260 ` There ' s nothing rational about this kind of action . ' 
1316 Of course , the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>. 
1415 Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>upon whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>now relies for financial sustenance . 
1591 The financial - services industry was battered by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash . 
1655 What ' s more , although the stock market is far less overvalued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>economy is weaker . 
1771 Growth is slower . 
1789 Profits are softer . 
1809 Debt burdens are heavier . 
1837 But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate . 
1975 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>, which until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>had been resisting moves to ease credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets . 
2122 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest - rate policies . 
2237 But the experience of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash suggests the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>is likely to bring down short - term interest rates in its effort to calm markets . 
2374 Anticipating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>' s move , money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 . 625 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday </TIMEX>, down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 . 820 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day </TIMEX>before . 
2533 Tiny movements in the rate , which is what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>charge each other for overnight loans , are usually among the few visible tracks that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>leaves on the monetary markets . 
2708 The dollar also began to decline <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>as the stock market ' s plunge caused some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>to reassess their desire to invest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
2846 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>have been arguing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months </TIMEX>that the dollar ' s strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals , threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers </ENAMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years </TIMEX>. 
3060 The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>was right about the overpriced dollar . 
3182 A modest drop in the dollar - - only a modest one , mind you - - would be welcomed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
3274 That was n't the case in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, when the dollar was so weak that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists </ENAMEX>and government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>seriously worried that it might collapse , producing panic among foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
3518 Another big difference between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>is n't so comforting . 
3584 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter of 1987 </TIMEX>, the economy spurted at an inflation - adjusted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 . 3 % </NUMEX>. 
3680 The consensus among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists </ENAMEX>is that it grew a much more sluggish <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 . 3 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter of 1989 </TIMEX>, which ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two weeks ago </TIMEX>. 
3812 The plunge in stock prices ` is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Chimerine </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">WEFA Group </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bala Cynwyd </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa . </ENAMEX>, forecasting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
3996 ` A lot of pent - up demand is gone . ' 
4033 Consumer spending did drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the months </TIMEX>following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>- - ` but only slightly and for a short period of time , ' recalls Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zarnowitz </ENAMEX>, a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student </ENAMEX>of business cycles . 
4219 ` That was offset by strength elsewhere . 
4259 -LCB- The effects -RCB- were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected . ' 
4349 Today , he frets , exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>and if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>retrench in reaction . 
4520 What ' s more , the corporate borrowing binge has n't abated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two years </TIMEX>. 
4600 ` We ' ve had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two more years </TIMEX>of significant accumulation of debt . . . just at the time when earnings are being squeezed , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chimerine </ENAMEX>notes . 
4741 The more a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>relies on borrowed money , the greater its sensitivity to an economic slowdown . 
4839 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm ; a highly leveraged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>may end up in bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>. 
4976 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>, of course , knows that very well - - hence its readiness to pump credit into the economy <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning </TIMEX>. 
5086 But , in the process , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>risks reigniting inflation . 
5143 Even before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s events , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard University </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Friedman </ENAMEX>was arguing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>and highly leveraged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>. 
5422 The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession , he reasons ; it ' s an outbreak of uncontrolled inflation . 
5550 In the end , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>collapse suggested , the economy does n't move in lockstep with stock prices . 
5647 The economy does , however , depend on the confidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>. 
5747 A panic on Wall Street does n't exactly inspire confidence . 
5808 Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
5875 A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 </NUMEX>- point drop is n't likely to make much of a dent ; multiply that a few times over , though , and it will . 
5982 If the reactions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>gathered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday </TIMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hot Springs </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va . </ENAMEX>, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Business Council </ENAMEX>meetings are typical , business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>were n't overly rattled by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s decline . 
6160 And if foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>become a tad more cautious - - well , the dollar ' s recent strength suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>can stand it . 
6289 On the bottom line , the most comforting fact for the economic outlook is that we ' ve been through this before . 
6399 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago </TIMEX>, about the only point of comparison was the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1929 </TIMEX>crash and the subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Depression </ENAMEX>. 
6499 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doomsayers </ENAMEX>had a receptive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience </ENAMEX>. 
6540 The prosperity that followed <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>permits a more optimistic view <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. 
6622 At the very least , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">establishment </ENAMEX>here is taking comfort from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s success in handling the last go - around . 
6740 As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>-RRB- observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>, ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>avoided a meltdown last time . 
6833 They are more sophisticated this time .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Sisulu </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">African National Congress </ENAMEX>came home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
80 After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">26 years </TIMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu </ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">77 - year - old </TIMEX>former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary - general </ENAMEX>of the liberation movement , was dropped off at his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house </ENAMEX>by a prison <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">services </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">van </ENAMEX>just as the sun was coming up . 
273 At the same time , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>of whom were arrested with him in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1963 </TIMEX>and sentenced to life imprisonment , were reunited with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families </ENAMEX>at various places around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>. 
465 And as the graying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men </ENAMEX>returned to their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>, outlawed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa </ENAMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960 </TIMEX>and still considered to be the chief public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy </ENAMEX>by the white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>, defiantly returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>' s black <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">townships </ENAMEX>. 
701 A huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>flag , with black , green and gold stripes , was hoisted over the rickety gate at Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu </ENAMEX>' s modest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house </ENAMEX>, while on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street </ENAMEX>out front , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys </ENAMEX>displayed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>colors on their shirts , caps and scarves . 
914 At the small <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>- room <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elias Motsoaledi </ENAMEX>, a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unionist </ENAMEX>and a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">group </ENAMEX>' s armed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">wing </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Umkhonto we Sizwe </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">well - wishers </ENAMEX>stuck little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>flags in their hair and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>ribbons . 
1168 ` I am happy to see the spirit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>, ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu </ENAMEX>, looking dapper in a new gray suit . 
1266 As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd </ENAMEX>outside his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home </ENAMEX>shouted ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>, ' the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>shot his fists into the air . 
1357 ` I ' m inspired by the mood of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>. ' 
1401 Under the laws of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">land </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>remains an illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">organization </ENAMEX>, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters </ENAMEX>are still in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lusaka </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Zambia </ENAMEX>. 
1520 But the unconditional release of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>, who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>, is a de facto unbanning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">movement </ENAMEX>and the rebirth of its internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">wing </ENAMEX>. 
1721 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>can never put the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>back into the bottle again , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cassim Saloojee </ENAMEX>, a veteran anti - apartheid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist </ENAMEX>on hand to welcome Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu </ENAMEX>. 
1875 ` Things have gone too far for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>to stop them now . 
1938 There ' s no turning back . ' 
1966 There was certainly no stopping the tide of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>emotion <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night </TIMEX>, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>jammed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Holy Cross Anglican Church </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Soweto </ENAMEX>for what became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>rally in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 years </TIMEX>. 
2175 Deafening chants of ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>' and ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Umkhonto we Sizwe </ENAMEX>' shook the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church </ENAMEX>as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX>aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men </ENAMEX>vowed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>would continue its fight against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts , including the armed struggle . 
2416 And they called on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>to release <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Mandela </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>' s leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure </ENAMEX>, who was jailed with them and remains in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison </ENAMEX>. 
2551 Without him , said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu </ENAMEX>, the freeing of the others ` is only a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half </NUMEX>- measure . ' 
2635 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F . W . de Klerk </ENAMEX>released the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men </ENAMEX>- - along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of the founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Pan Africanist Congress </ENAMEX>, a rival liberation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">group </ENAMEX>- - as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>can begin negotiations with black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>over a new constitution aimed at giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks </ENAMEX>a voice in national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>. 
2991 But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pretoria </ENAMEX>may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>. 
3105 As other repressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments </ENAMEX>, particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union </ENAMEX>, have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control . 
3337 As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the days </TIMEX>go by , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South African </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandela </ENAMEX>as well as the continued banning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>and enforcement of the state of emergency . 
3556 If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>, the expectations and promise raised by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>' s releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest . 
3745 If it does , the large number of right - wing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites </ENAMEX>, who oppose any concessions to the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority </ENAMEX>, will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands . 
3927 The newly released <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>also will be under enormous pressure . 
3996 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>is watching closely to see if their presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">townships </ENAMEX>leads to increased anti - government protests and violence ; if it does , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pretoria </ENAMEX>will use this as a reason to keep Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandela </ENAMEX>behind bars . 
4211 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pretoria </ENAMEX>has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>place : for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>. 
4365 In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>and between the newly freed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>and those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists </ENAMEX>who have emerged as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>during their imprisonment . 
4625 In order to head off any divisions , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandela </ENAMEX>, in a meeting with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues </ENAMEX>before they were released , instructed them to report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lusaka </ENAMEX>as soon as possible . 
4817 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men </ENAMEX>also will be faced with bridging the generation gap between themselves and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>' s many militant black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youths </ENAMEX>, the so - called young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions </ENAMEX>who are anxious to see the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions </ENAMEX>in action . 
5016 Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Mokaba </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">South African Youth Congress </ENAMEX>: ` We will be expecting them to act like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>. ' 
5144 They never considered themselves to be anything else . 
5198 At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night </TIMEX>' s rally , they called on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers </ENAMEX>to be firm , yet disciplined , in their opposition to apartheid . 
5315 ` We emphasize discipline because we know that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>is very , very sensitive , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Mlangeni </ENAMEX>, another early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Umkhonto </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader </ENAMEX>who is now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">63 </TIMEX>. 
5469 ` We want to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Mandela </ENAMEX>and all our comrades out of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison </ENAMEX>, and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio L . Savoca </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">66 years old </TIMEX>, was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atlantic Research Corp . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>. 
133 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savoca </ENAMEX>had been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>' s rocket - propulsion operations . 
216 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savoca </ENAMEX>succeeds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William H . Borten </ENAMEX>, who resigned to pursue personal interests .

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece </ENAMEX>' s second bout of general elections <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>is slated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov . 5 </TIMEX>. 
83 For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored - - in view of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece </ENAMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight - year </TIMEX>misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three - month </TIMEX>hitch with a conservative - communist coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>- - there is but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>bright sign : The scandals still encircling former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andreas Papandreou </ENAMEX>and his fallen socialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>are like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies </ENAMEX>buzzing around a rotting carcass . 
503 In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid - June </TIMEX>round of voting , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greeks </ENAMEX>gave no clear mandate to any single political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party </ENAMEX>. 
596 The ad interim coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>that emerged from post - electoral hagglings was , in essence , little more than the ill - conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation : On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>side , the center - right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">New Democracy Party </ENAMEX>, headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine Mitsotakis </ENAMEX>. 
852 On the other , the so - called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Coalition of the Left and Progress </ENAMEX>- - a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Communist Party </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece </ENAMEX>and its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Euro </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">cousin </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Hellenic Left </ENAMEX>. 
1063 The unifying bond for this left - right mismatch was plain : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX>-LRB- Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party </ENAMEX>-RRB- as common political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">enemy </ENAMEX>. 
1179 The ostensible goal was a mop - up of government corruption , purportedly at all levels , but the main marks were Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou </ENAMEX>and his closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates </ENAMEX>. 
1332 In point of fact , this catharsis was overdue by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decades </TIMEX>. 
1389 When reduced to buzzword status in ex parte pledges , however , the notion transmogrified into a promised assault , with targets primarily for political gains , not justice . 
1561 With regard to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece </ENAMEX>' s long - bubbling bank - looting scandal , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou </ENAMEX>' s principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accuser </ENAMEX>remains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Koskotas </ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Crete </ENAMEX>and self - confessed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embezzler </ENAMEX>, now residing in a jail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">cell </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Salem </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass . </ENAMEX>, from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece </ENAMEX>. 
1873 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas </ENAMEX>' s credibility is , at best , problematic . 
1926 He has ample motive to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points . 
2045 Nevertheless , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">New Democracy </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">parties </ENAMEX>herald his assertions as proof of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX>complicity . 
2153 Among unanswered questions are whether Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou </ENAMEX>received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23 million </NUMEX>of stolen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Crete </ENAMEX>funds and an additional <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 734 , 000 </NUMEX>in bribes , as contended ; whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister </ENAMEX>ordered state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies </ENAMEX>to deposit <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 57 million </NUMEX>in Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>and then skim off the interest ; and , what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX>' s cut was from the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 210 million </NUMEX>Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas </ENAMEX>pinched . 
2515 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two </NUMEX>former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers </ENAMEX>were so heavily implicated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas </ENAMEX>affair that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parliament </ENAMEX>voted to refer them to the special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>. 
2661 But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of drachmas </NUMEX>Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas </ENAMEX>funneled into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">New Democracy </ENAMEX>coffers . 
2780 In the end , the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and ` indications ' that point to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX>, not clinching proof . 
2910 On another issue , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greeks </ENAMEX>were told how their national intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EYP </ENAMEX>, regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures </ENAMEX>, including key opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX>cabinet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>. 
3141 Despite convincing arguments , it was never established that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou </ENAMEX>personally ordered or directed the wiretaps . 
3263 The central weakness of the ` scandals ' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks . 
3395 The coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>tried to show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers </ENAMEX>had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">F - 16 Fighting Falcon </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Mirage 2000 </ENAMEX>combat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft </ENAMEX>, produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Dynamics Corp . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avions Marcel Dassault </ENAMEX>, respectively . 
3659 Naturally , neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Dynamics </ENAMEX>nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dassault </ENAMEX>could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid -LRB- or not -RRB- to various <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greek </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>for services rendered . 
3864 So it seems that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitsotakis </ENAMEX>and his communist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chums </ENAMEX>may have unwittingly served Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou </ENAMEX>a moral victory on a platter : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX>, whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou </ENAMEX>' s expense . 
4128 But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX>regain power , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou </ENAMEX>should never be underestimated . 
4240 <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First </NUMEX>came his predictable fusillade : He charged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Coalition of the Left </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Progress </ENAMEX>had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right - wing plot aimed at ousting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX>and thwarting the course of socialism in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece </ENAMEX>. 
4472 Then , to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">parties </ENAMEX>to stand for election under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX>banner . 
4607 Next , he continued to court the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communists </ENAMEX>- - many of whom feel betrayed by the left - right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">coalition </ENAMEX>' s birth - - by bringing into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX>a well - respected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Communist Party </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate </ENAMEX>. 
4786 For balance , and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes , he managed to attract a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">New Democracy Party </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative </ENAMEX>and known political enemy of Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitsotakis </ENAMEX>. 
4967 Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX>heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal - stench , but also with ` seals of approval ' from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives </ENAMEX>of its harshest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accusers </ENAMEX>. 
5122 Crucial as these elections are for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece </ENAMEX>, pressing issues of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state </ENAMEX>are getting lost in the shuffle . 
5223 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>' s future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NATO </ENAMEX>participation remains unsure , for instance . 
5293 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece </ENAMEX>also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992 </TIMEX>targets of heightened Common Market cooperation . 
5422 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece </ENAMEX>' s bilateral relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>need attention soon as well . 
5494 For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>, the current accord concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">bases </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece </ENAMEX>lapses in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 1990 </TIMEX>. 
5583 Negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June </TIMEX>elections , but the clock is running . 
5683 Another matter of concern is the extradition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Rashid </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Palestinian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist </ENAMEX>who is wanted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982 </TIMEX>bombing of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan American Airways </ENAMEX>flight . 
5853 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greek </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts </ENAMEX>have decided in favor of extradition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rashid </ENAMEX>case , but the matter awaits final approval from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece </ENAMEX>' s next justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister </ENAMEX>. 
6001 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greeks </ENAMEX>seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece </ENAMEX>will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism . 
6170 That <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX>could win the elections outright is improbable ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greek </ENAMEX>press , previously eager to palm off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX>' s line , has turned on Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou </ENAMEX>with a wild - eyed vengeance . 
6346 Yet the possibility of another lash - up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>is all too real . 
6413 If Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou </ENAMEX>becomes the major opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader </ENAMEX>, he could hamstring a conservative - led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">coalition </ENAMEX>. 
6517 Also , he could force new elections <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year </TIMEX>by frustrating the procedures for the election of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">republic </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March </TIMEX>. 
6660 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">New Democracy </ENAMEX>has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prospects </ENAMEX>to negative reaction against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK </ENAMEX>, forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles . 
6883 As for Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou </ENAMEX>? 
6906 He ' s not exactly sitting pretty at this stage . 
6953 But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slingers </ENAMEX>who ever raked muck , it seems far wiser to view him as sidelined , but certainly not yet eliminated . 
7124 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter </ENAMEX>, a regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Review </ENAMEX>, has lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Athens </ENAMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981 </TIMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Rocha Garza </ENAMEX>said he sold a block of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600 , 000 </NUMEX>shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Laboratories Inc . </ENAMEX>common stock to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>affiliated with him . 
158 In a filing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rocha Garza </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Biscayne Syndicate Inc . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lahus II Inc . </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lahus III Inc . </ENAMEX>bought the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600 , 000 </NUMEX>shares on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 11 </TIMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 4 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 375 </NUMEX>a share . 
371 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rocha Garza </ENAMEX>said that he , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Clarendon Group Ltd . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Biscayne </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lahus II </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lahus III </ENAMEX>are all affiliated and hold a combined stake of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 234 , 100 </NUMEX>shares , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 . 33 % </NUMEX>. 
533 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rocha Garza </ENAMEX>has said he wants to purchase more shares . 
594 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Diego </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Laboratories </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Wollaeger </ENAMEX>said the transfer of the shares is n't significant .  

9 Put down that phone . 
32 Walk around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room </ENAMEX>; take two deep breaths . 
77 Resist the urge to call your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker </ENAMEX>and sell all your stocks . 
141 That ' s the advice of most investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals </ENAMEX>after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 </NUMEX>- point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . 
261 No one can say for sure what will happen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. 
309 And investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next six months </TIMEX>. 
410 But they ' re nearly unanimous on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>point : Do n't sell into a panic . 
480 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors </ENAMEX>who sold everything after the crash of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>lived to regret it . 
554 Even after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48 % </NUMEX>above where it landed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 19 two years ago </TIMEX>. 
673 Panic selling also was unwise during other big declines in the past . 
742 The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">crash of 1929 </ENAMEX>was followed by a substantial recovery before the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">great Depression </ENAMEX>and awful bear market of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1930s </TIMEX>began . 
869 The ` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October </TIMEX>massacres ' of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1978 </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979 </TIMEX>were scary , but did n't lead to severe or sustained downturns . 
974 Indeed , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros </ENAMEX>see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge , plus any further damage that might occur <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early this week </TIMEX>, as a chance for bargain hunting . 
1104 ` There has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you ' ve got the cash , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen B . Timbers </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief investment officer </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper Financial Services Inc .  
1312 But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers </ENAMEX>think the immediate course for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>should be to stand pat . 
1406 ` When you see a runaway <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">train </ENAMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Janachowski </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX>investment advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Brouwer &amp; Janachowski </ENAMEX>, ` you wait for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">train </ENAMEX>to stop . ' 
1575 Even for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>who expect a bear market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming months </TIMEX>- - and a sizable number of money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>and market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits </ENAMEX>do - - the advice is : Wait for the market to bounce back , and sell shares gradually during rallies . 
1793 The best thing individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>can do is ` just sit tight , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall B . Front </ENAMEX>, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of investment counseling at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stein Roe &amp; Farnham Inc . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>- based investment counseling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>that manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 18 billion </NUMEX>. 
2046 On the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>hand , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Front </ENAMEX>says , it would be misguided to sell into ` a classic panic . ' 
2133 On the other hand , it ' s not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy . 
2205 ` This is all emotion right now , and when emotion starts to run , it can run further than anyone anticipates , ' he said . 
2323 ` So it ' s more prudent to wait and see how things stabilize . ' 
2386 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Ibbotson </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor </ENAMEX>of finance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Yale University </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of the market information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ibbotson Associates Inc . </ENAMEX>, says , ` My real advice would be to just ride through it . 
2564 Generally , it is n't wise to be in and out ' of the stock market . 
2630 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibbotson </ENAMEX>thinks that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>is ` going to be a roller - coaster <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">week </TIMEX>. ' 
2705 But he also thinks it is ` a good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">week </TIMEX>to consider buying . ' 
2766 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Snyder </ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">chapter </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Investors Corp . </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization </ENAMEX>of investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">clubs </ENAMEX>and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>, says his fellow club <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>did n't sell in the crash of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, and see no reason to sell <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now </TIMEX>. 
3027 ` We ' re dedicated long - term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>, ' he says . 
3088 ` We understand panics and euphoria . 
3124 And we hope to take advantage of panics and buy stocks when they plunge . ' 
3200 One camp of investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros </ENAMEX>sees what happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>as an opportunity . 
3273 Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next days </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks </TIMEX>, they say , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>should look for stocks to buy . 
3356 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s action ` was an old - fashioned panic , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Goldman </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of technical market analysis for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A . G . Edwards &amp; Sons </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St . Louis </ENAMEX>. 
3499 ` Stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price . ' 
3555 His advice : ` You ought to be there with a basket catching them . ' 
3622 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Craig </ENAMEX>, portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Janus Fund </ENAMEX>, which has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of the industry ' s better track records , started his buying during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge . 
3783 Stocks such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hershey Foods Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wal - Mart Stores Inc . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American International Group Inc . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal National Mortgage Association </ENAMEX>became such bargains that he could n't resist them , he says . 
3979 And Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig </ENAMEX>expects to pick up more shares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. 
4031 ` It will be chaotic at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>, but I would not be buying if I thought we were headed for real trouble , ' he says . 
4143 He argues that stocks are reasonably valued now , and that interest rates are lower now than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fall of 1987 </TIMEX>. 
4258 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Front </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stein Roe </ENAMEX>suggests that any buying should ` concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side , or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction . ' 
4465 His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>favors selected computer , drug and pollution - control stocks . 
4537 Other investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros </ENAMEX>are more pessimistic . 
4581 They say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>should sell stocks - - but not necessarily right away . 
4654 Many of them stress that the selling can be orderly , gradual , and done when stock prices are rallying . 
4759 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Fleckenstein </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seattle </ENAMEX>money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>, used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline . 
4927 He thinks the underlying inflation rate is around <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % to 6 % </NUMEX>, far higher than most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>suppose . 
5026 In the pension accounts he manages , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleckenstein </ENAMEX>has raised cash positions and invested in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold </ENAMEX>and natural gas stocks , partly as an inflation hedge . 
5180 He thinks government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>are terrified to let a recession start when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>, corporate and personal debt levels are so high . 
5315 So he thinks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>will err on the side of rekindled inflation . 
5390 As a result , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleckenstein </ENAMEX>says , ` I think the ball game ' s over , ' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>are about to face a bear market . 
5507 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David M . Jones </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aubrey G . Lanston &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, recommends <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>securities -LRB- of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">up to five years </TIMEX>' maturity -RRB- . 
5630 He says the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 6 </TIMEX>employment report , showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector , is a warning sign to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>. 
5785 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>strategy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>who want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy ` put ' options , either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index . 
5947 A put option gives its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder </ENAMEX>the right -LRB- but not the obligation -RRB- to sell a stock -LRB- or stock index -RRB- for a specified price -LRB- the strike price -RRB- until the option expires . 
6114 Whether this insurance is worthwhile depends on the cost of an option . 
6185 The cost , or premium , tends to get fat in times of crisis . 
6244 Thus , buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk . 
6336 The prices of puts generally did n't soar <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
6385 For example , the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eli Lilly &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>moved up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 % </NUMEX>at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday </TIMEX>' s close to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3 . 3 % </NUMEX>at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s close , even though the shares dropped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 5 . 50 </NUMEX>. 
6598 But put - option prices may zoom when trading resumes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. 
6659 It ' s hard to generalize about a reasonable price for puts . 
6718 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>should keep in mind , before paying too much , that the average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>return for stock holdings , long - term , is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 % to 10 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year </TIMEX>; a return of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % </NUMEX>is considered praiseworthy . 
6904 Paying , say , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>for insurance against losses takes a deep bite out of the return . 
6989 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A . White </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Herman </ENAMEX>contributed to this article .  

9 Of all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>- time expenses incurred by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation </ENAMEX>or professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease . 
189 To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation </ENAMEX>or professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms . 
377 It must also evaluate the real - estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective . 
469 Specifically , it must understand how real - estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities . 
618 When a regional economy catches <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold </ENAMEX>, the local real - estate market gets <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia </ENAMEX>. 
701 In other words , real - estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , plummet much further than a local economy in recession . 
851 This was seen in the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960s </TIMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid - 1970s </TIMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>. 
929 But the reverse is also true : When a region ' s economy rebounds from a slowdown , these real - estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy . 
1092 Why do local real - estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles ? 
1164 Because real - estate purchases and leases are such major long - term commitments that most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals </ENAMEX>make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth . 
1362 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Metropolitan Detroit </ENAMEX>was written off economically during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s </TIMEX>, as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment . 
1518 Area employment dropped by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 % </NUMEX>from its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979 </TIMEX>peak and retail sales were down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 % </NUMEX>. 
1600 However , the real - estate market was hurt even more . 
1652 For example , residential building permits in the trough year of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982 </TIMEX>were off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76 % </NUMEX>from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979 </TIMEX>peak level . 
1762 Once metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit </ENAMEX>' s economy rallied in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid - 1980s </TIMEX>, real estate rebounded . 
1847 Building permits , for example , soared a staggering <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">400 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1982 and the peak year of 1986 </TIMEX>. 
1945 Where , savvy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>and professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>are now asking , are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>' s opportunities ? 
2039 Look no further than metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>of the most depressed , overbuilt and potentially undervalued real - estate markets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>. 
2193 Of course , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers </ENAMEX>have touted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past five years </TIMEX>as a counter - cyclical play . 
2302 But now appears to be the time to act . 
2343 Metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>' s economy did drop and then flatten in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years </TIMEX>after its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982 </TIMEX>peak . 
2434 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid - 1980s </TIMEX>, employment was down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 5 % </NUMEX>from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982 </TIMEX>peak and retail sales were off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 % </NUMEX>. 
2538 The real - estate market suffered even more severe setbacks . 
2597 Office construction dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97 % </NUMEX>. 
2630 The vacancy rate soared <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 % </NUMEX>in nearly every product category , and more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % </NUMEX>of office space was vacant . 
2748 To some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers </ENAMEX>, the empty office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>' s ` see - through skyline ' were indicative of a very troubled economy . 
2875 As usual , the real - estate market had overreacted . 
2925 Actually , the region ' s economy retained a firm foundation . 
2984 Metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population </ENAMEX>has held steady over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past six years </TIMEX>. 
3059 And personal income , after slumping in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid - 1980s </TIMEX>, has returned to its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982 </TIMEX>level in real dollar terms . 
3168 Today , metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>' s real - estate market is poised for a significant turnaround . 
3257 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 42 , 000 </NUMEX>jobs were added in metro <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry . 
3399 This growth puts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>in the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>metro areas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>. 
3477 And forecasts project a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 . 5 % to 3 % </NUMEX>growth rate in jobs over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few years </TIMEX>- - nearly twice the national average . 
3596 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>is another metropolitan area where the commercial real - estate market has overreacted to the region ' s economic trends , although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>. 
3800 By some measures , metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>' s economy has actually improved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past four years </TIMEX>. 
3894 Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population </ENAMEX>has continued to increase since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983 </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the peak year </TIMEX>of the economic cycle . 
3984 Employment is now <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 % </NUMEX>higher than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983 </TIMEX>. 
4026 Buying income in real dollars actually increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1983 and 1987 </TIMEX>-LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the most recent year </TIMEX>available -RRB- . 
4137 The rates of increase , however , are less than the rapid growth of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the boom years </TIMEX>, and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy . 
4281 In a self - fulfilling prophecy , therefore , the region ' s real - estate market all but collapsed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years </TIMEX>. 
4390 Housing building permits are down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 75 % </NUMEX>from their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983 </TIMEX>peaks . 
4463 Although no one can predict when metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>' s real - estate market will rebound , major public works projects costing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several billion dollars </NUMEX>are under way or planned - - such as a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">convention center </ENAMEX>, a major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">beltway </ENAMEX>encircling the metropolitan area , and a new regional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport </ENAMEX>. 
4750 When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>' s regional economy begins to grow faster - - such a recovery could occur <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as early as next year </TIMEX>- - business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real - estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound . 
5000 What real - estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>' s or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>' s ? 
5143 Generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid - 1980s </TIMEX>peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX>. 
5324 Vacancy rates in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 19 % </NUMEX>range <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>may easily rise to the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">low to mid - 20 % </NUMEX>range in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a couple of years </TIMEX>. 
5434 Under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic growth - - ` catching <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold </ENAMEX>' - - in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>and professional service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia </ENAMEX>. 
5710 Those looking for real - estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short - term -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three - year </TIMEX>-RRB- lease and wait for the bargains ahead .

195 In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal year </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Siemens </ENAMEX>will hold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74 . 9 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matsushita </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matsushita Electronic Components Co . </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 . 1 % </NUMEX>. 
346 A basic agreement between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>was announced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June </TIMEX>. 
415 The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>is to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Siemens Matsushita Components G . m . b . H </ENAMEX>. 
487 It will have its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Munich .  
530 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matsushita </ENAMEX>' s share in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>will rise to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 1 , 1990 </TIMEX>, and to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the following Oct . 1 </TIMEX>. 
628 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Siemens </ENAMEX>will retain majority voting rights . 
674 The parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>forecast sales for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 750 million marks </NUMEX>for its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal year </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matsushita </ENAMEX>said . 
798 Sales are expected to rise to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one billion marks </NUMEX>after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years </TIMEX>. 
864 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>will have production <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Austria </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain </ENAMEX>.

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aluminum Co . of America </ENAMEX>, hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas , said net income for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 . 2 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 219 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 46 </NUMEX>a share . 
171 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s No . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 </NUMEX>aluminum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 226 . 3 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 56 </NUMEX>a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
264 Revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 83 billion </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 56 billion </NUMEX>. 
320 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>, who were expecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alcoa </ENAMEX>to post <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 2 . 70 to $ 3 </NUMEX>a share , were surprised at the lackluster <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>results . 
447 ` It ' s disappointing , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Siedenburg </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney , Harris Upham &amp; Co .  
545 Much of the earnings decline was led by currency - exchange rate adjustments , which affected the bottom line by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 . 3 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 cents </NUMEX>a share , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 6 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four cents </NUMEX>a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous year </TIMEX>. 
763 Lower prices for aluminum ingots and certain alloy products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said . 
908 ` In addition , costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant outages for modernization work , ' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said . 
1023 Excluding the higher tax rate , which rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>percentage points to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38 % </NUMEX>, and the negative exchange rate adjustment , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>would have met <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>' expectations , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R . Wayne Atwell </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co .  
1250 Noting that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>is usually the aluminum industry ' s slowest , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atwell </ENAMEX>added , ` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>is never a bang up period for them anyway . ' 
1407 Nevertheless , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said shipments were up slightly to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">679 , 000 metric tons </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">671 , 000 </NUMEX>, buffing the impact of the unexpected earning decline . 
1558 The results were announced after the stock market closed . 
1616 In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>composite trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alcoa </ENAMEX>closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 72 </NUMEX>a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 75 </NUMEX>, in a sharply lower market .

9 The chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>because of skidding prices in the commodity end of the business . 
161 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Producers </ENAMEX>of commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals </ENAMEX>, the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals </ENAMEX>produced in huge volumes for other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers </ENAMEX>, have seen sharp inventory cutting by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>. 
310 Once the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">beneficiaries </ENAMEX>of the industry ' s now fading boom , these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers </ENAMEX>also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 third quarter </TIMEX>. 
484 ` For some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>, this will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter </TIMEX>with year - to - year negative comparisons , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Bogner </ENAMEX>, a chemical industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential Bache Research </ENAMEX>. 
665 ` This could be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six </NUMEX>down quarters . ' 
723 Perhaps most prominent , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Chemical Co . </ENAMEX>, which as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">midyear </TIMEX>had racked up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">eight consecutive record quarters </TIMEX>, is expected to report that profit decreased in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter </TIMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>, if only by a shade . 
941 Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>has aggressively diversified into specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">pharmaceuticals </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>still has a big stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene </ENAMEX>, which is used in packaging and housewares . 
1123 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>estimates for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Midland </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>are between <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 20 </NUMEX>a share and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 30 </NUMEX>a share , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 36 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago </TIMEX>, when profit was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 632 million </NUMEX>on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 15 billion </NUMEX>. 
1322 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman </ENAMEX>declined to comment on the estimates . 
1380 At the investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney , Harris Upham &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, the commodity - chemical segment is seen pulling down overall profit for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>representative of the whole industry by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 % to 10 % </NUMEX>. 
1575 ` You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>about even or slightly better , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wilbur </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>. 
1738 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp . </ENAMEX>projects that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 </NUMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>it follows will report lower profit . 
1831 Most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 </NUMEX>have big commodity - chemical operations . 
1888 Still , some industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants </ENAMEX>are expected to report continuing gains , largely because so much of their business is outside commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals </ENAMEX>. 
2031 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont Co . </ENAMEX>is thought to have had steady profit growth in white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pigments </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fibers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polymers </ENAMEX>. 
2127 Moreover , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wilmington </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Del . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>is helped when prices weaken on the commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals </ENAMEX>it buys for its own production needs , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">ethylene </ENAMEX>. 
2281 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>are divided over whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont </ENAMEX>will report much of a gain in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter </TIMEX>from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conoco Inc . </ENAMEX>oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
2406 The estimates for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont </ENAMEX>range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 25 to $ 2 . 45 </NUMEX>a share . 
2467 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 third quarter </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 461 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 91 </NUMEX>a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 . 99 billion </NUMEX>. 
2572 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont </ENAMEX>declined to comment . 
2603 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Monsanto Co . </ENAMEX>, too , is expected to continue reporting higher profit , even though its sales of crop <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals </ENAMEX>were hurt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter </TIMEX>by drought in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>and the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
2794 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St . Louis </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>is expected to report again that losses in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">G . D . Searle &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business </ENAMEX>are narrowing . 
2926 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Searle </ENAMEX>continued to operate in the red through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of the year </TIMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Monsanto </ENAMEX>has said it expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Searle </ENAMEX>to post a profit for all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>. 
3077 Most estimates for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Monsanto </ENAMEX>run <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 1 . 70 and $ 2 </NUMEX>a share . 
3139 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year ago </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>posted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 116 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 67 </NUMEX>a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 02 billion </NUMEX>. 
3253 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Monsanto </ENAMEX>declined to comment . 
3285 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">commodity - chemical </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers </ENAMEX>are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle . 
3369 By some accounts on Wall Street and in the industry , the inventory reductions are near an end , which may presage firmer demand . 
3497 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doubters </ENAMEX>say growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990s </TIMEX>. 
3596 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter </TIMEX>, at least , profit is expected to fall sharply . 
3665 For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Himont Inc . </ENAMEX>, ` how far down it is , we do n't know , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Ravitz </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers </ENAMEX>. 
3759 The projections are in the neighborhood of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents </NUMEX>a share to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents </NUMEX>, compared with a restated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 65 </NUMEX>a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>, when profit was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 107 . 8 million </NUMEX>on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 435 . 5 million </NUMEX>. 
3948 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Himont </ENAMEX>faces lower prices for its mainstay product , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polypropylene </ENAMEX>, while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polypropylene </ENAMEX>, whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries . 
4215 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wilmington </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Del . </ENAMEX>, is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81 % </NUMEX>- owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Montedison S . p . A . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Milan </ENAMEX>, which has an offer outstanding for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Himont </ENAMEX>shares it does n't already own . 
4377 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum Chemical Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>, the trouble is lower prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene </ENAMEX>, higher debt costs and the idling of an important plant due to an explosion . 
4536 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>hedge their estimates for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>, because it is n't known when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>will book certain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>- time charges . 
4661 But the estimates range from break - even to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
4722 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 third quarter </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 99 . 8 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 92 </NUMEX>a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 724 . 4 million </NUMEX>. 
4827 Another big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Carbide Corp . </ENAMEX>, is expected to post profit of between <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 </NUMEX>a share and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 25 </NUMEX>, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 56 </NUMEX>a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 213 million </NUMEX>on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 11 billion </NUMEX>. 
5053 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Himont </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Carbide </ENAMEX>all declined to comment .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business Week </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers </ENAMEX>may hear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>' s issue talking back to them . 
86 A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>- page ad from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Instruments Inc . </ENAMEX>, running in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 140 , 000 </NUMEX>issues of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 20 </TIMEX>` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Corporate Elite </ENAMEX>' issue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McGraw - Hill Inc . </ENAMEX>publication , contains a speech synthesizer laminated between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>of the pages . 
312 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers </ENAMEX>who pull off a piece of tape and press a switch will hear a tiny - - but distinctly human - sounding - - voice announce , ` I am the talking chip , ' as it launches into a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 - second </TIMEX>discourse on its own attributes . 
529 The talking chip is n't cheap - - the per - ad cost to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Instruments </ENAMEX>is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 4 </NUMEX>, and that ' s without adding in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business Week </ENAMEX>' s charge - - but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Instruments </ENAMEX>believes it is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>. 
712 Previous efforts have included musical ads , featuring simple tone - generating chips that play a tune , but the voice synthesizer in this effort is much more sophisticated , with none of the robotic flatness that one hears , for example , when calling telephone directory services . 
990 And for those who miss the message the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>time around , not to worry : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three </NUMEX>tiny batteries provide enough juice for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 650 </NUMEX>replays .  

9 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>announced a new , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12 - year </TIMEX>Canada Savings Bond issue that will yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 . 5 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first year </TIMEX>. 
137 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>interest rate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each of the next 11 years </TIMEX>will be set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each fall </TIMEX>, when details of a new series are released . 
260 Canada Savings Bonds are major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>instruments for meeting its financial requirements . 
354 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 41 . 4 billion Canadian dollars </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US $ 35 . 2 billion </NUMEX>-RRB- of such bonds currently outstanding . 
466 Only <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents </ENAMEX>are permitted to buy Canada Savings Bonds , which may be redeemed any time at face value . 
579 The bonds go on sale <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 19 </TIMEX>.  

9 The state - controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">insurer </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Assurances Generales de France </ENAMEX>said it has obtained regulatory approval to increase its stake in the financial holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cie . de Navigation Mixte </ENAMEX>above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>from the current level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 % </NUMEX>. 
238 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s approval was needed to conform with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Bourse </ENAMEX>rules regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>with bank interests and follows a similar approval given <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday </TIMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cie . Financiere de Paribas </ENAMEX>. 
414 Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AGF </ENAMEX>have been increasing their stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte </ENAMEX>recently for what they have termed ` investment purposes , ' although the issue has been surrounded by takeover speculation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks </TIMEX>. 
629 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AGF </ENAMEX>did n't comment officially on its reasons for seeking the approval , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>said it was done to make sure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>would have the flexibility to increase its stake in the future , should interesting price opportunities arise . 
882 An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AGF </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>did specify , however , that there was no foundation to recent rumors the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>might be acting in concert with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer Inc . </ENAMEX>said it will offer cash rebates on several of its machines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">from Oct . 14 to Dec . 31 </TIMEX>. , as part of a holiday - season sales promotion . 
161 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>will offer a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 rebate </NUMEX>on its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">IIGS </ENAMEX>with any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Monitor </ENAMEX>and disk drive ; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 </NUMEX>on the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macintosh </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Plus </ENAMEX>central processing unit ; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 </NUMEX>on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macintosh </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">SE </ENAMEX>central processing unit ; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 </NUMEX>on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macintosh </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">SE \/ 30 cpu </ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 </NUMEX>on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macintosh </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">IIcx </ENAMEX>with any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>video card and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>monitor . 
464 The rebates , as a percentage of the retail cost of the cpu of each system , amount to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 % to 13 % </NUMEX>. 
562 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>is also offering a free trial of its computers to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>who qualify for its credit cards or leases .  

9 The economy ' s temperature will be taken from several vantage points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>, with readings on trade , output , housing and inflation . 
145 The most troublesome report may be the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>merchandise trade deficit due out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow </TIMEX>. 
235 The trade gap is expected to widen to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 9 billion </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 . 6 billion </NUMEX>, according to a survey by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MMS International </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McGraw - Hill Inc . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>. 
400 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday </TIMEX>' s report on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>consumer price index is expected to rise , although not as sharply as the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 9 % </NUMEX>gain reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>in the producer price index . 
563 That gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s session , before it got started on its reckless <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 </NUMEX>- point plunge . 
712 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists </ENAMEX>are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow </TIMEX>. 
883 Meanwhile , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>housing starts , due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday </TIMEX>, are thought to have inched upward . 
972 ` There ' s a possibility of a surprise ' in the trade report , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Englund </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MMS </ENAMEX>. 
1082 A widening of the deficit , if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar , would exacerbate trade problems - - but the dollar weakened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>as stocks plummeted . 
1251 In any event , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Englund </ENAMEX>and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made . 
1368 ` Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next six or seven months </TIMEX>as improvement begins to slow , ' he said . 
1505 Exports are thought to have risen strongly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>, but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists </ENAMEX>said . 
1633 Views on manufacturing strength are split between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists </ENAMEX>who read <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>' s low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations . 
1866 The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences : The forecasts run from a drop of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 5 % </NUMEX>to an increase of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 4 % </NUMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MMS </ENAMEX>. 
2038 A rebound in energy prices , which helped push up the producer price index , is expected to do the same in the consumer price report . 
2170 The consensus view expects a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 4 % </NUMEX>increase in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>CPI after a flat reading in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>. 
2268 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert H . Chandross </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd ' s Bank </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>, is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level . 
2427 ` Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI , and at the CPI level they wo n't , ' he said . 
2514 Food prices are expected to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 4 % </NUMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Ciminero </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fleet \/ Norstar Financial Group </ENAMEX>. 
2659 He also says he thinks ` core inflation , ' which excludes the volatile food and energy prices , was strong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>. 
2775 He expects a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 0 . 5 % </NUMEX>in core inflation after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer </TIMEX>of far smaller increases . 
2873 Housing starts are expected to quicken a bit from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>pace of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 350 , 000 </NUMEX>units . 
2964 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists </ENAMEX>say an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>rebound in permits for multifamily <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">units </ENAMEX>signaled an increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>starts , though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards .  

9 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 years </TIMEX>, federal rules have barred the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>major television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest - growing parts of the television business . 
181 And for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six years </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS </ENAMEX>have negotiated with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>in a futile attempt to change that . 
294 But with foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>snapping up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>are pressing their fight harder than ever . 
409 They hope the foreign deals will divide the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood </ENAMEX>opposition and prod <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air . 
641 Even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>, however , admit privately that victory - - either in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>or in talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>- - is highly doubtful any time soon . 
792 And so the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>also are pushing for new ways to sidestep the ` fin - syn ' provisions , known formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules . 
946 That became clear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>with the disclosure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Broadcasting Co . </ENAMEX>, backed by the deep pockets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co . </ENAMEX>, had tried to help fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia Ltd . </ENAMEX>' s now - scuttled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 5 billion </NUMEX>bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM \/ UA Communications Co .  
1193 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>' s interest may revive the deal , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM \/ UA </ENAMEX>killed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>had trouble raising cash . 
1315 Even if that deal is n't revived , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>hopes to find another . 
1375 ` Our doors are open , ' an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>says . 
1420 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>may yet find a way to take a passive , minority interest in a program - maker without violating the rules . 
1528 And any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>effort could prompt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Inc . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capital Cities \/ ABC Inc . </ENAMEX>, to look for ways of skirting the fin - syn regulations . 
1668 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>' push may only aggravate an increasingly bitter rift between them and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>. 
1774 Both sides are to sit down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month </TIMEX>for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing fin - syn restraints . 
1892 Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>privy to the talks expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>to budge . 
1953 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>still are ` uninhibited in their authority ' over what shows get on the air , charges <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Motion Picture Association </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Valenti </ENAMEX>, the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules . 
2154 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Studios </ENAMEX>are ` powerless ' to get shows in prime - time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends . 
2292 And that ' s why the rules , for the most part , must stay in place , he says . 
2368 Studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>in on the talks - including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paramount Communications Inc . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fries Entertainment Inc . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Communications Inc . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA Inc . </ENAMEX>- - declined to be interviewed . 
2553 But Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valenti </ENAMEX>, who represents the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>, asserts : ` The whole production industry , to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>, is on the side of preserving ' the rules . 
2692 Such proclamations leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>all the more doubtful that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>will bend . 
2785 ` They do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate , ' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>network <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>. 
2866 ` And there ' s no indication that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>is prepared to address the rules . 
2943 That ' s the problem , is n't it ? ' 
2976 Indeed it is . 
2990 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess , urging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>, which license rights to air shows made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>, to work out their own compromise . 
3177 But recent developments have made the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>- - and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Wright </ENAMEX>, in particular - - ever more adamant that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>must be unshackled to survive . 
3344 The latest provocation : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony Corp . </ENAMEX>' s plan to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc . </ENAMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 4 billion </NUMEX>, and to buy independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber Peters Entertainment Co . </ENAMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million </NUMEX>. 
3536 ` I wonder what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Cronkite </ENAMEX>will think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony \/ Columbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Rather </ENAMEX>broadcast exclusively from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>, ' wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J . B . Holston </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, in a commentary in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>' s issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Broadcasting </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>. 
3796 In his article , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holston </ENAMEX>, who was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>and unavailable , complained that the ` archaic restraints ' in fin - syn rules have ` contributed directly to the acquisition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>by non - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">enterprises </ENAMEX>. ' 
4015 -LRB- He did n't mention that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>, in the meantime , was hoping to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex </ENAMEX>in buying 
4113 An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>counters that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holston </ENAMEX>' s lament was ` entirely consistent ' with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>plans because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>rules would limit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>' s involvement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex </ENAMEX>deal so severely as to be ` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">light years </TIMEX>away from the type of unrestrained deals available to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>- - and everyone else except the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>. ' 
4422 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Big Three </ENAMEX>' s drumbeat for deregulation began intensifying in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer </TIMEX>when the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Inc . </ENAMEX>went ahead with plans to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner </ENAMEX>. 
4564 Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX>already had a long - term contract to buy movies from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner </ENAMEX>, the merger will let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX>' s largely unregulated pay - cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">channel </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Home Box Office </ENAMEX>, own the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner </ENAMEX>movies aired on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HBO </ENAMEX>- - a vertical integration that is effectively blocked by fin - syn regulations . 
4836 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>' s Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright </ENAMEX>led the way in decrying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>' inability to match a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time - Warner </ENAMEX>combination . 
4937 He spoke up again when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia </ENAMEX>was announced . 
5001 Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>' s interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex </ENAMEX>bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM \/ UA </ENAMEX>was disclosed , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright </ENAMEX>has n't been available for comment . 
5112 With a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex </ENAMEX>deal , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>would move into uncharted territory - - possibly raising hackles at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>. 
5236 ` It ' s never really been tested , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lilley III </ENAMEX>, who as a top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years </TIMEX>lobbying to have the rules lifted . 
5368 He now runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Policy Communications </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>, consulting to media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>. 
5448 Fin - syn rules do n't explicitly block a network from buying a passive , small stake in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>that profits from the rerun syndication <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>ca n't enjoy . 
5607 Hence , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC </ENAMEX>might be able to take , say , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % </NUMEX>stake in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM \/ UA </ENAMEX>. 
5686 If the transaction raised objections , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio </ENAMEX>' s syndication <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations </ENAMEX>could be spun off into a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>does n't have a direct stake . 
5851 But such convolutions would still block the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication . 
5960 Under current rules , even when a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>fares well with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 % </NUMEX>- owned series - - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC </ENAMEX>, for example , made a killing in broadcasting its popular crime \/ comedy ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Moonlighting </ENAMEX>' - - it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations </ENAMEX>. 
6229 Instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC </ENAMEX>will have to sell off the rights for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>- time fee . 
6297 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim - - for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years </TIMEX>at the least . 
6411 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Six years ago </TIMEX>they were tantalizingly close . 
6456 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan </ENAMEX>- era <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Communications Commission </ENAMEX>had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules . 
6554 Various evidence , including a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Brookings Institution </ENAMEX>study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 800 </NUMEX>series that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>had aired and had partly owned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s </TIMEX>, showed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>did n't wield undue control over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>as had been alleged . 
6781 But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">just eight days </TIMEX>before the rules were to die , former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan </ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>- time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor </ENAMEX>, intervened on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood </ENAMEX>. 
6916 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FCC </ENAMEX>effort collapsed . 
6944 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>have bickered ever since . 
6995 Network <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>, but that seems unlikely . 
7130 In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>, the issue falters : It ' s about money , not program quality , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood </ENAMEX>has lots of clout given its fund raising for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives </ENAMEX>overseeing the issue . 
7313 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward J . Markey </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass . </ENAMEX>-RRB- , who heads a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee </ENAMEX>that oversees the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FCC </ENAMEX>, says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markey </ENAMEX>feels ` the world has been forever changed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia </ENAMEX>deal . ' 
7496 But he said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markey </ENAMEX>hopes this pushes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios </ENAMEX>to work it out on their own . 
7591 And at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FCC </ENAMEX>, meanwhile , new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred C . Sikes </ENAMEX>has said he wants the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sides </ENAMEX>to hammer out their own plan .  

9 Sharp increases in the price of fresh produce caused <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain </ENAMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>consumer price index to shoot up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 1 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous month </TIMEX>, pushing the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>rate of inflation to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 . 8 % </NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Institute of Statistics </ENAMEX>said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
241 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly </TIMEX>increase is the highest recorded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past four years </TIMEX>. 
312 The index , which registered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">156 . 8 </NUMEX>at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of September </TIMEX>, has a base of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983 </TIMEX>and is n't <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">seasonally </TIMEX>adjusted . 
434 Prices have risen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 . 9 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months of the year </TIMEX>, outstripping both the initial <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 % </NUMEX>inflation goal set by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Socialist </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe Gonzalez </ENAMEX>and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>, revised goal of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 . 8 % </NUMEX>.

157 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lomas </ENAMEX>, assisted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets </ENAMEX>, has been trying to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Equitable Lomas Leasing Co . </ENAMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several months </TIMEX>, apparently without success . 
313 The real estate and mortgage banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>had hoped to use proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt . 
418 Without cash from asset sales and unable to reach a new bank - credit agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lomas </ENAMEX>defaulted on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 145 million </NUMEX>in notes that became due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 1 </TIMEX>.

9 The inflation - adjusted growth rate for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>' s gross domestic product for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter </TIMEX>was revised upward to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 8 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous three months </TIMEX>from the initial estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 7 % </NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Statistics Institute </ENAMEX>said .

384 If the economy continues to expand by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 8 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a quarter </TIMEX>for the rest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year </TIMEX>, it would leave GDP growth for all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 % </NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">institute </ENAMEX>said .

459 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giant </ENAMEX>agreed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>to purchase the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier </ENAMEX>. 
508 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giant </ENAMEX>has n't ever disclosed the proposed price , although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avmark Inc . </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Arlington </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va . </ENAMEX>- based aircraft consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>, has valued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aspen </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fleet </ENAMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 46 million </NUMEX>. 
680 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline </ENAMEX>would have become the latest in a peculiar blend of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giant </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>, which are involved in making cement , recycling newsprint and operating fast - food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants </ENAMEX>.  

9 Dismal sales at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp . </ENAMEX>dragged the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>car and truck market down below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - ago </TIMEX>levels in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early October </TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>sales period of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>model year . 
178 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight </NUMEX>major domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>sold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160 , 510 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American </ENAMEX>- made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first 10 days of October </TIMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 . 6 % </NUMEX>drop from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>. 
320 Domestically built truck sales were down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 . 4 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86 , 555 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">pickups </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vans </ENAMEX>and sport utility <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles </ENAMEX>. 
421 The heavy use of incentives to clear out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models </ENAMEX>appears to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>model sales , which began officially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 1 </TIMEX>. 
583 This appears particularly true at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>, which had strong sales in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>but saw its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early October </TIMEX>car and truck results fall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 . 3 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>' s unusually high level . 
768 Overall , sales of all domestic - made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles </ENAMEX>fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 . 9 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago </TIMEX>. 
841 Without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>, overall sales for the other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">automakers </ENAMEX>were roughly flat with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>results . 
936 Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>have already adopted incentives on many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models </ENAMEX>, but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up . 
1080 ` We ' ve created a condition where , without incentives , it ' s a tough market , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Kelly </ENAMEX>, sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bill Wink Chevrolet </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dearborn </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich .  
1231 Car sales fell to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">seasonally </TIMEX>adjusted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>selling rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 . 8 million </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles </ENAMEX>, the lowest since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>. 
1347 The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost eight million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>. 
1441 Furthermore , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>contacted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last week </TIMEX>said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s steep market decline . 
1576 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>' s domestic car sales dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 . 3 % </NUMEX>and its domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks </ENAMEX>were down an even steeper <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 . 7 % </NUMEX>from the same period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago </TIMEX>. 
1703 All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions </ENAMEX>except <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cadillac </ENAMEX>showed big declines . 
1764 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cadillac </ENAMEX>posted a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 . 2 % </NUMEX>increase despite new competition from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus </ENAMEX>, the fledging luxury - car <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota Motor Corp .  
1887 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus </ENAMEX>sales were n't available ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars </ENAMEX>are imported and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota </ENAMEX>reports their sales only at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">month - end </TIMEX>. 
1992 The sales drop for the No . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>may have been caused in part by the end in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>of dealer incentives that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>offered in addition to consumer rebates and low - interest financing , a company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said . 
2207 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>had a different program in place that continued rewarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>until all the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models </ENAMEX>had been sold . 
2330 Aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>posted generally mixed results .

2494 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler Corp . </ENAMEX>had a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 5 % </NUMEX>drop in car sales , echoing its generally slow performance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">all year </TIMEX>. 
2588 However , sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks </ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">minivans </ENAMEX>, rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 . 3 % </NUMEX>. 
2669 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda Motor Co . </ENAMEX>' s sales of domestically built <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles </ENAMEX>plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21 . 7 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>.

2863 ` We ' re really confident everything will bounce back to normal , ' he added . 
2939 Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler </ENAMEX>said firm prices on its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>- model domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">minivans </ENAMEX>will rise an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % </NUMEX>over comparably equipped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models </ENAMEX>. 
3087 Firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this fall </TIMEX>. 
3177 At that time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler </ENAMEX>said base prices , which are n't adjusted for equipment changes , would rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 4 % and 9 % </NUMEX>on most vehicle .

359 The addition , on top of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>big <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>additions to foreign - loan reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79 % </NUMEX>of medium - term and long - term loans outstanding to troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations </ENAMEX>.

T Industries PLC </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>that is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers </ENAMEX>. 
461 In an attempt to appease <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>' concern over a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldsmith </ENAMEX>acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers </ENAMEX>, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>agreed to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa </ENAMEX>if he is successful in acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B . A . T .  
644 As part of the agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa </ENAMEX>agreed to invest <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion </NUMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake Investments Ltd . </ENAMEX>, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James </ENAMEX>' s acquisition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">vehicle </ENAMEX>. 
766 Of the total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 5 billion </NUMEX>to be paid to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake </ENAMEX>by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 billion </NUMEX>will come from available resources of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa - Midi Group </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 25 billion </NUMEX>will be in the form of notes issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa </ENAMEX>, and the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 25 billion </NUMEX>will be in long - term bank loans . 
1032 In an interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Bebear </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa </ENAMEX>, said his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>has already obtained assurances from a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cie . Financiere de Paribas </ENAMEX>that they can provide the loan portion of the financing . 
1278 The other banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>in the group are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Credit Lyonnais </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Societe Generale </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica Corp . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp </ENAMEX>, he said . 
1401 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa - Midi Group </ENAMEX>has ` <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 2 . 5 billion </NUMEX>of non - strategic assets that we can and will sell ' to help pay off debt from the acquisition . 
1554 He said the assets to be sold would be ` non - insurance ' assets , including a beer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>and a real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, and would n't include any pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers </ENAMEX>. 
1710 ` We wo n't put any burden on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers </ENAMEX>, ' he said . 
1759 The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake </ENAMEX>has an absolute obligation to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa </ENAMEX>upon an acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B . A . T .  
1910 ` We hope that with what we did , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>will not need to evaluate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake </ENAMEX>, and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake </ENAMEX>wo n't be an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers </ENAMEX>at anytime , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear </ENAMEX>said . 
2122 Any change of control in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers </ENAMEX>needs approval of the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners </ENAMEX>in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers </ENAMEX>and its related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>are incorporated . 
2280 The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake </ENAMEX>, and to reflect the extension that Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James </ENAMEX>received <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition . 
2499 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake </ENAMEX>dropped its initial <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 13 . 35 billion </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 . 71 billion </NUMEX>-RRB- takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa </ENAMEX>receives regulatory approval . 
2719 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B . A . T </ENAMEX>said of the amended filings that , ` It would appear that nothing substantive has changed . 
2830 The new financing structure is still a very - highly leveraged one , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa </ENAMEX>still plans to take out <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers </ENAMEX>' earnings as dividends to service their debt . ' 
2990 That dividend is almost double the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 % </NUMEX>currently taken out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers </ENAMEX>by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B . A . T </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>added . 
3091 ` It would have severe implications for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers </ENAMEX>' policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders </ENAMEX>. ' 
3158 To fend off Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James </ENAMEX>' s advances , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B . A . T </ENAMEX>has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would pare it to a tobacco and financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Corp . of Santa Barbara </ENAMEX>filed suit against former stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculator </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan F . Boesky </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . </ENAMEX>, charging they defrauded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>by concealing their relationship when persuading it to buy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 284 million </NUMEX>in high - yield , high - risk junk bonds . 
279 In a suit filed in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S &amp; L </ENAMEX>alleged that a ` disproportionate number ' of the bonds it purchased in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984 </TIMEX>declined in value . 
424 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Corp . </ENAMEX>purchased the bonds , the suit alleged , after Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel </ENAMEX>negotiated an agreement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Vagabond Hotels </ENAMEX>to purchase a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 % </NUMEX>stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 34 million </NUMEX>. 
614 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Vagabond Hotels </ENAMEX>was controlled by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky </ENAMEX>, who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations . 
726 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel </ENAMEX>said they had n't seen the suit and thus could n't comment . 
806 In addition to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33 million </NUMEX>compensatory damages , the suit seeks <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million </NUMEX>in punitive damages . 
906 Also named in the suit is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ivan F . Boesky Corp . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northview Corp . </ENAMEX>, the successor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Vagabonds Hotels </ENAMEX>. 
1017 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northview </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>could n't be located . 
1060 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Corp . </ENAMEX>said it agreed to buy the bonds after a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ivan F . Boesky Corp . </ENAMEX>visited it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November 1983 </TIMEX>and said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Corp . </ENAMEX>could improve its financial condition by purchasing the bonds . 
1271 Shortly before the visit , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representives </ENAMEX>had met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Corp . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 % </NUMEX>stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
1447 However , the agreement was canceled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1984 </TIMEX>. 
1499 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Corp . </ENAMEX>purchased the bonds in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 70 </NUMEX>different transactions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984 </TIMEX>and since then has realized <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 million </NUMEX>in losses on them , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said .  

9 reminiscent of those during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash - - that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity escalated , some phone calls to market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>in over - the - counter stocks went unanswered . 
198 ` We could n't get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>to answer their phones , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert King </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>of OTC trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robinson - Humphrey Co . </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta </ENAMEX>. 
340 ` It was -LCB- like -RCB- the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>. 
404 Whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq </ENAMEX>stocks sank far less than those on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>. 
537 Nonetheless , the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year </TIMEX>and its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth </NUMEX>worst ever , diving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 . 90 </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 % </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">467 . 29 </NUMEX>. 
682 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten </NUMEX>points of the drop occurred during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last 45 minutes </TIMEX>of trading . 
753 By comparison , the New York Stock Exchange Composite tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 . 8 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>and the American Stock Exchange Composite fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 % </NUMEX>. 
879 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 16 , 1987 </TIMEX>, the Nasdaq Composite fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 . 18 </NUMEX>points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 . 8 % </NUMEX>, followed by its devastating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 . 12 </NUMEX>- point , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 % </NUMEX>slide , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three days later </TIMEX>. 
1021 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq </ENAMEX>volume <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">167 . 7 million </NUMEX>shares , which was only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fifth busiest day </TIMEX>so far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
1127 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">single - day </TIMEX>record of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">288 million </NUMEX>shares was set on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 21 </TIMEX>, 
1193 ` There was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E . E . ` Buzzy ' Geduld </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Herzog , Heine , Geduld </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>that makes markets in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands </NUMEX>of OTC issues . 
1405 Most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers </ENAMEX>rather than individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>. 
1518 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robinson - Humphrey </ENAMEX>and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>' inability to handle the volume of calls , rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades . 
1734 The subject is a sore one for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq </ENAMEX>and its market - making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>, which were widely criticized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>following complaints from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>who could n't reach their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers </ENAMEX>or trade in the chaos of the crash . 
1954 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter DaPuzzo </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of retail equity trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton </ENAMEX>, declared : ` It was the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last hour </TIMEX>of trading on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
2082 There were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>to be as efficient as robots . 
2201 It was n't intentional , we were all busy . ' 
2245 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Tarantino </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of OTC trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hambrecht &amp; Quist </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX>, said , ` It was just like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>. 
2360 Everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time . ' 
2423 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremiah Mullins </ENAMEX>, the OTC trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter Reynolds </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>, said proudly that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>executed every order it received by the close of trading . 
2588 But , he added , ` you can only take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>call at a time . ' 
2645 Market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur . 
2741 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days </TIMEX>like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, that means they must buy shares from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers </ENAMEX>when no one else is willing to . 
2839 When selling is so frenzied , prices fall steeply and fast . 
2898 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago </TIMEX>, faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories , market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>themselves began dumping shares , exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices . 
3085 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, some market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>were selling again , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>said . 
3149 But , with profits sagging on Wall Street since the crash , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand . 
3263 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tarantino </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hambrecht &amp; Quist </ENAMEX>said some prices fell without trades taking place , as market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares . 
3423 ` Everyone was hitting everyone else ' s bid , ' he said . 
3478 So , while OTC <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>incurred losses on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>said the damage was n't as bad as it was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>. 
3596 ` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago </TIMEX>we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit . 
3675 I do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robinson - Humphrey </ENAMEX>. 
3767 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Cecin </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of equity trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Piper , Jaffray &amp; Hopwood </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis </ENAMEX>, said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Piper Jaffray </ENAMEX>actually made money on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
3901 It helped that his inventory is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX>smaller now than it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>, he said . 
3991 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Hardiman </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Securities Dealers </ENAMEX>, which oversees the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq </ENAMEX>computerized trading system , said that despite the rush of selling , he never considered the situation an ` emergency . ' 
4215 ` The pace of trading was orderly , ' he said . 
4259 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq </ENAMEX>' s Small Order Execution System ` worked beautifully , ' as did the automated system for larger trades , according to Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardiman </ENAMEX>. 
4395 Nevertheless , the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>' confidence . 
4510 In the past , the OTC market thrived on a firm base of small - investor participation . 
4594 Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq </ENAMEX>' s trading volume has n't returned to pre - crash levels , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>and OTC market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>hope the damage wo n't be permanent . 
4734 But they are worried . 
4756 ` We were just starting to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public </ENAMEX>' s confidence back , ' lamented Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullins </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter </ENAMEX>. 
4856 More troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of small - investor support the OTC market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>crash . 
5070 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cecin </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Piper Jaffray </ENAMEX>says some action from government policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers </ENAMEX>would allay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX>fears . 
5172 It wo n't take much more to ` scare the hell out of retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>, ' he says . 
5252 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers </ENAMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>came from all corners of the OTC market - - big and small institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>, as well as individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>and market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>. 
5407 But grateful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>said the sell orders generally ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 , 000 </NUMEX>shares to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 , 000 </NUMEX>shares , compared with blocks of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 , 000 </NUMEX>shares or more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>. 
5567 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson </ENAMEX>' s Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DaPuzzo </ENAMEX>said retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>nervously sold stock <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>and never returned to bargain - hunt . 
5676 Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>, which had been selling stock throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>to lock in handsome gains made through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, were calmer . 
5824 ` We had a good amount of selling from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>, but not as much panic , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DaPuzzo </ENAMEX>said . 
5918 ` If they could n't sell , some of them put the shares back on the shelf . ' 
5990 In addition , he said , some bigger institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>placed bids to buy some OTC stocks whose prices were beaten down . 
6116 In addition , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DaPuzzo </ENAMEX>said computer - guided program selling of OTC stocks in the Russell Index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2000 </NUMEX>small stocks and the Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 - stock Index sent occasional ` waves ` through the market . 
6323 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq </ENAMEX>' s biggest stocks were hammered . 
6362 The Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest nonfinancial issues , including the big OTC technology issues , tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 . 2 % </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 . 76 </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">449 . 33 </NUMEX>. 
6495 The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 % </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 . 31 </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">462 . 98 </NUMEX>. 
6594 The OTC market has only a handful of takeover - related stocks . 
6656 But they fell sharply . 
6679 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw Cellular Communications </ENAMEX>, for instance , has offered to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN Broadcasting </ENAMEX>as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Metromedia </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City </ENAMEX>cellular telephone interests , and in a separate transaction , sell certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw </ENAMEX>properties to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Contel Cellular </ENAMEX>. 
6909 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw </ENAMEX>lost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 % </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 </NUMEX>. 
6941 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN Broadcasting </ENAMEX>, dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>. 
6993 The turnover in both issues was roughly normal . 
7043 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a day </TIMEX>when negative takeover - related news did n't sit well with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commercial Intertech </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of engineered metal parts , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Haas &amp; Partners </ENAMEX>advised it that it does n't plan to pursue its previously reported <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27 . 50 </NUMEX>- a - share bid to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
7303 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commercial Intertech </ENAMEX>plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 </NUMEX>. 
7345 The issues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
7424 On the OTC market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Executive </ENAMEX>, a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer </ENAMEX>of the high - risk , high - yield issues , slid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>. 
7529 Among other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">OTC </ENAMEX>issues , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel </ENAMEX>, dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1 \/ 8 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 7 \/ 8 </NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Laidlaw Transportation </ENAMEX>lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1 \/ 8 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>depositary receipts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar </ENAMEX>were off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI Communications </ENAMEX>slipped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer </ENAMEX>fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nike </ENAMEX>dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66 3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>.  

9 Of all the ethnic tensions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America </ENAMEX>, which is the most troublesome right now ? 
89 A good bet would be the tension between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jews </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City </ENAMEX>. 
163 Or so it must seem to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Mason </ENAMEX>, the veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedian </ENAMEX>appearing in a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC </ENAMEX>sitcom airing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights </TIMEX>-LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 : 30 - 10 p . m . EDT </TIMEX>-RRB- . 
302 Not only is Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star </ENAMEX>of ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Chicken Soup </ENAMEX>, ' he ' s also the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inheritor </ENAMEX>of a comedic tradition dating back to ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Duck Soup </ENAMEX>, ' and he ' s currently a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>in hot water . 
468 Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>' s remarks , quoted <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Village Voice </ENAMEX>while he was a paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani </ENAMEX>mayoral campaign , and then in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newsweek </ENAMEX>after he and the campaign parted company . 
701 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>said that many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters </ENAMEX>feel guilty toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks </ENAMEX>, so they support black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates </ENAMEX>uncritically . 
814 He said that many black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters </ENAMEX>feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates </ENAMEX>uncritically . 
939 He said that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jews </ENAMEX>have contributed more to black causes over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years </TIMEX>than vice versa . 
1029 Of course , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>did not use neutral language . 
1080 As a practitioner of ethnic humor from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the old days </TIMEX>on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Borscht Belt </ENAMEX>, live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>instinctively reached for the vernacular . 
1248 He said <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jews </ENAMEX>were ` sick with complexes ' ; and he called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani </ENAMEX>' s black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent </ENAMEX>, ` a fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shvartze </ENAMEX>with a mustache . ' 
1387 If Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">New Yorkers </ENAMEX>, would the water be quite so hot ? 
1552 It probably would , because few or none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>upset by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>' s remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language . 
1747 In addition , some of Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics </ENAMEX>have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism . 
1861 For example , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NAACP </ENAMEX>said that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>is ` like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur </ENAMEX>. 
1956 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . ' 
2012 These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics </ENAMEX>fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>, such as ` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish </ENAMEX>jokes ' ; and the type that is double - edged , aiming inward as well as outward . 
2212 The latter typically is the humor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underdog </ENAMEX>, and it was perfected by both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jews </ENAMEX>on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences </ENAMEX>along with themselves . 
2426 In the hands of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">zealot </ENAMEX>like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny Bruce </ENAMEX>, this double - edged blade could cut both the self and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience </ENAMEX>to ribbons . 
2546 But wielded by a pro like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Mason </ENAMEX>, it is a constructive form of mischief . 
2625 Why constructive ? 
2643 Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co - existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups </ENAMEX>in conflict . 
2858 That ' s why it ' s dangerous to have well - intentioned thought <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police </ENAMEX>, on college <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">campuses </ENAMEX>and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences . 
3011 As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Kristol </ENAMEX>wrote in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times </ENAMEX>just before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>donnybrook , ` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer . ' 
3202 The question is , if group conflicts still exist -LRB- as undeniably they do -RRB- , and if Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>' s type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ? 
3383 Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy . 
3556 It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies </ENAMEX>vs . blue - collar <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Bostonians </ENAMEX>in ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Cheers </ENAMEX>' ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children </ENAMEX>vs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults </ENAMEX>in ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Cosby Show </ENAMEX>. ' 
3716 But these are not the differences that make headlines . 
3773 In ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Chicken Soup </ENAMEX>, ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bachelor </ENAMEX>courting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maddie </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynn Redgrave </ENAMEX>-RRB- , an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother </ENAMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>, against the wishes of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rita Karin </ENAMEX>-RRB- and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brandon Maggart </ENAMEX>-RRB- . 
3992 It ' s worth noting that both disapproving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives </ENAMEX>are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants </ENAMEX>. 
4059 At least , they both speak with strong accents , as do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maddie </ENAMEX>. 
4131 It could n't be more obvious that ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Chicken Soup </ENAMEX>' is being made from an old recipe . 
4213 And a safe one - - imagine if the romance in question were between an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Orthodox Jew </ENAMEX>and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Nation of Islam </ENAMEX>. 
4334 Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1920s </TIMEX>, the play and movie versions of ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Abie ' s Irish Rose </ENAMEX>' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants </ENAMEX>so popular that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Nichols </ENAMEX>, lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain . 
4622 And it has remained there , as evidenced by its reappearance in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972 </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS </ENAMEX>sitcom called ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Bridget Loves Bernie </ENAMEX>, ' whose sole distinction was that it led to the real - life marriage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredith Baxter </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Birney </ENAMEX>. 
4838 Clearly , the question with ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Chicken Soup </ENAMEX>' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all . 
4954 So far , the bubbles have been few and far between . 
5005 Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the didactic days </TIMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Lear </ENAMEX>, to preach about social issues . 
5133 To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them . 
5257 For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael </ENAMEX>dislikes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie </ENAMEX>not because he ' s a shrewd <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman </ENAMEX>, but because he quits his well - paying job as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman </ENAMEX>in order to become a social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker </ENAMEX>. 
5432 Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>' s comic persona . 
5535 The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old - fashioned <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish </ENAMEX>mischief to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>as well as to himself . 
5772 But too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>' s stock in trade - ethnic differences . 
5928 I ' m not suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers </ENAMEX>start putting together episodes about topics like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Catholic </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish </ENAMEX>dispute over the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Carmelite </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">convent </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Auschwitz </ENAMEX>. 
6085 That issue , like racial tensions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City </ENAMEX>, will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can simmer . 
6195 But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason </ENAMEX>to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about ` caring for other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss America </ENAMEX>. 
6383 At your age , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie </ENAMEX>, you ought to know that you ca n't make soup without turning up the flame .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp . </ENAMEX>, in a series of moves that angered union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>, has signaled that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as five </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American </ENAMEX>assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>may not survive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid - 1990s </TIMEX>as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation </ENAMEX>struggles to cut its excess vehicle - making capacity . 
274 In announcements to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>effectively signed death notices for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>full - sized van assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>, and cast serious doubt on the futures of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories </ENAMEX>. 
463 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>is under intense pressure to close <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories </ENAMEX>that became unprofitable as the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>market share skidded during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past decade </TIMEX>. 
612 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, currently using <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 % </NUMEX>of its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American </ENAMEX>vehicle capacity , has vowed it will run at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 % </NUMEX>of capacity by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992 </TIMEX>. 
742 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just a month ago </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>announced it would make an aging assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lakewood </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ga . </ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility </ENAMEX>to close since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>. 
886 Now , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the 1990s </TIMEX>. 
989 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>reason is mounting competition from new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>that are pouring out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one million </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles </ENAMEX>a year at costs lower than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>can match . 
1158 Another is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Auto Workers </ENAMEX>union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>have signaled they want tighter no - layoff provisions in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Big Three </ENAMEX>national contract that will be negotiated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>. 
1337 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force </ENAMEX>in place before those talks begin . 
1452 The problem , however , is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>' s moves are coming at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UAW </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>are trying to silence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissidents </ENAMEX>who charge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union </ENAMEX>is too passive in the face of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>layoffs . 
1627 Against that backdrop , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UAW </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen P . Yokich </ENAMEX>, who recently became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">department </ENAMEX>, issued a statement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>blasting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>' s ` flagrant insensitivity ' toward union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>. 
1830 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>' s decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>showed ` disarray ' and an ` inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yokich </ENAMEX>said . 
2085 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>of the following moves : Production of full - sized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vans </ENAMEX>will be consolidated into a single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Flint </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich .  
2239 That means <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>- - one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Scarborough </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ontario </ENAMEX>, and the other in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lordstown </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio </ENAMEX>- - probably will be shut down after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1991 </TIMEX>. 
2379 The shutdowns will idle <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX>assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2 , 500 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio </ENAMEX>. 
2474 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert White </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Canadian Auto Workers </ENAMEX>union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>, used the impending <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Scarborough </ENAMEX>shutdown to criticize the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>free trade agreement and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney </ENAMEX>. 
2668 But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX>auto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>may benefit from a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>move that affects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Quebec </ENAMEX>. 
2786 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Van Nuys </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oklahoma City </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pontiac </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich . </ENAMEX>, were told their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities </ENAMEX>are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pontiac </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Firebird </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevrolet </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Camaro </ENAMEX>muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars </ENAMEX>. 
3004 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>is studying whether it can build the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Camaro - Firebird </ENAMEX>profitably at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St . Therese </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Quebec </ENAMEX>, company and union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>said . 
3146 That announcement left union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Van Nuys </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oklahoma City </ENAMEX>uncertain about their futures . 
3246 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Van Nuys </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>, which employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>, does n't have a product to build after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1993 </TIMEX>. 
3345 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Shrieves </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UAW </ENAMEX>local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility </ENAMEX>was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a ` flex <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>, ' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand . 
3557 At the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oklahoma City </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>, which employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 6 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>building the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">eight - year - old </TIMEX>A - body mid - sized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Featherston </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UAW </ENAMEX>local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>has no new product lined up , and ` none of us knows ' when the A - body <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars </ENAMEX>will die . 
3813 He said he believes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>has plans to keep building A - body <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars </ENAMEX>into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid - 1990s </TIMEX>. 
3897 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pontiac </ENAMEX>, however , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Camaro - Firebird </ENAMEX>decision appears to erase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UAW </ENAMEX>hopes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>would reopen the shuttered assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>that last built the plastic - bodied , two - seater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pontiac Fiero </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">model </ENAMEX>. 
4094 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiero </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>was viewed as a model of union - management cooperation at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>before slow sales of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiero </ENAMEX>forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>to close the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factory </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>. 
4252 Union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>have taken a beating politically as a result . 
4314 Dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UAW </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>have used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiero </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>as a symbol of labor - management cooperation ' s failure .  

9 It was n't so long ago that a radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>- - and originally by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Central Intelligence Agency </ENAMEX>- - was accused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>here of employing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">propagandists </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">imperialists </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies </ENAMEX>. 
218 Now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>has opened a news bureau in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">capital </ENAMEX>. 
288 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees </ENAMEX>held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign : ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Szabad Europa Radio </ENAMEX>' - - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>. 
402 ` I think this is a victory for the radio , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnabas de Bueky </ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">55 - year - old </TIMEX>former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugee </ENAMEX>who works in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Munich </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">headquarters </ENAMEX>as deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">service </ENAMEX>. 
605 In fact , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>hopes to set up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Warsaw </ENAMEX>and anywhere else in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bloc </ENAMEX>that will have it . 
716 But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>' s life in more ways than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>. 
833 In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>is in danger of suffering from its success . 
906 While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>currently can operate freely in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest </ENAMEX>, so can others . 
981 In addition , competition for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners </ENAMEX>is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled . 
1105 Instead of being denounced as an evil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agent </ENAMEX>of imperialism , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame , even boring . 
1267 ` They have a lot to do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">these days </TIMEX>to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX>radio , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Deak </ENAMEX>, a computer - science <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Technical University </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest </ENAMEX>. 
1421 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX>-LCB- radio -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters </ENAMEX>seem better informed and more critical about about what ' s going on here . ' 
1530 Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary </ENAMEX>is in the midst of a media explosion . 
1584 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boys </ENAMEX>on busy street <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">corners </ENAMEX>peddle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>of every political stripe . 
1657 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Newsstands </ENAMEX>are packed with a colorful array of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines </ENAMEX>. 
1715 Radio and television are getting livelier and bolder . 
1771 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Broadcasting Corp . </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice of America </ENAMEX>broadcast over <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX>airwaves , though <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few hours a day </TIMEX>each in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hungarian </ENAMEX>. 
1935 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian </ENAMEX>press magnate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch </ENAMEX>has bought <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX>stakes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>popular and gossipy <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Maxwell </ENAMEX>has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar moves . 
2145 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>does n't plan to fade away . 
2194 With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff </ENAMEX>says it still has plenty to do - - in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary </ENAMEX>and in the ` <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Great Eastern Beyond </ENAMEX>. ' 
2351 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>and its sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">station </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Liberty </ENAMEX>, say they wo n't cut back their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than 19 hours </TIMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX>broadcasts . 
2499 They are still an important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">source </ENAMEX>of news for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 million </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners </ENAMEX>in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 </NUMEX>exotic tongues : from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bulgarian </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Belorussian </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Kazakh </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Kirghiz </ENAMEX>. 
2645 The establishment of its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bureau </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Warsaw Pact </ENAMEX>territory shows the depth of some of the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe </ENAMEX>. 
2766 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Months </TIMEX>before the decision by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Communist Party </ENAMEX>to rename itself <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Socialist </ENAMEX>and try to look more appealing to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers </ENAMEX>were trying to look more hospitable . 
2953 It proved a perfect time for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>to ask for permission to set up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>. 
3042 Not only did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs </ENAMEX>approve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>' s new location , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ministry of Telecommunications </ENAMEX>did something even more amazing : ` They found us <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>phone lines in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest </ENAMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geza Szocs </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent </ENAMEX>who helped organize the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest </ENAMEX>location . 
3359 ` That is a miracle . ' 
3382 It ' s a far cry from the previous treatment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>, which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents </ENAMEX>-LRB- who filed reports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>by phone , secret <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers </ENAMEX>or letters -RRB- . 
3606 In fact , some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners </ENAMEX>say they owe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer </ENAMEX>here calls the ` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dark Ages of the 20th Century </TIMEX>. ' 
3833 ` During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past four years </TIMEX>, many of us have sat up until late at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night </TIMEX>listening to our radios , ' says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer </ENAMEX>. 
3948 ` There were some very brave broadcasts . ' 
3991 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners </ENAMEX>, too , had to be brave . 
4028 Through much of the post - <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II </ENAMEX>period , listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary </ENAMEX>. 
4130 ` When we listen to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">station </ENAMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother </ENAMEX>still gets nervous , ' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator </ENAMEX>. 
4228 ` She wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains . ' 
4290 Now , the toughest competition for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>comes during the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late - night </TIMEX>slot . 
4376 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">radio </ENAMEX>often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight </TIMEX>. 
4467 Television , which most of the time is considered rather tame , has entered the running with a new program , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The End of the Day </ENAMEX>, ' which comes on after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 p . m .  
4624 It is a talk show with opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>and political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts </ENAMEX>who discuss <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary </ENAMEX>' s domestic problems as well as foreign affairs . 
4756 Those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning </TIMEX>for ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Sunday Journal </ENAMEX>, ' on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hungarian Radio </ENAMEX>. 
4888 The competitive spirit is clearly influencing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>, which is trying to beef up programs . 
4990 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>plans to hire free - lance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters </ENAMEX>to cover the latest happenings in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX>country <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">towns </ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Nagykanizsa </ENAMEX>in the west to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Nyiregyhaza </ENAMEX>in the east . 
5160 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">service </ENAMEX>has a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 - minute </TIMEX>news show called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Newsreel </ENAMEX>, with international and domestic news , plus a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX>news review of opinions from around the world . 
5331 There ' s also a host of new programs , trying to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics . 
5426 A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35 - minute </TIMEX>program called ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The March of Time </ENAMEX>' tries to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world . 
5568 There ' s a program for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women </ENAMEX>and a science show . 
5616 And to attract younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>intersperses the latest in Western rock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups </ENAMEX>. 
5716 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Pet Shop Boys </ENAMEX>are big <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest </ENAMEX>. 
5767 ` We are starving for all the news , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deak </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student </ENAMEX>. 
5831 ` Every moment we want to know everything about the world .  

9 Government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>here and in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>laid plans through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>to head off a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>market meltdown - - but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet . 
184 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan </ENAMEX>was on the telephones , making it clear to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>and abroad that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>, if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis . 
471 And at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady </ENAMEX>talked with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates </ENAMEX>on Wall Street while Assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Mullins </ENAMEX>carefully analyzed data on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>market plunge . 
662 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters . 
753 In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>would give them more strength and flexibility should <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s market drop turn into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning </TIMEX>' s rout . 
993 ` The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , ' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>, insisting on anonymity . 
1183 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>' s efforts at secrecy were partly foiled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning </TIMEX>, when both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Washington Post </ENAMEX>carried stories quoting a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>saying the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank </ENAMEX>was prepared to pour cash into the banking system <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning </TIMEX>. 
1436 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan </ENAMEX>was surprised by both stories , according to knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources </ENAMEX>, and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment . 
1580 Nevertheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank </ENAMEX>' s game plan . 
1702 It is prepared to assume the same role it played in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>, providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat . 
1849 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>. 
1957 The reticence of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>was evident in the appearance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday </TIMEX>of Budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman </ENAMEX>on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC </ENAMEX>' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">This Week </ENAMEX>. ' 
2085 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC </ENAMEX>and others have been in close contact . 
2208 I ' m sure they ' ll do what ' s right , what ' s prudent , what ' s sensible , ' he said . 
2287 When it was suggested his comment was a ` non - answer , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman </ENAMEX>replied : ` It is a non - answer . 
2382 But , in this context , that ' s the smart thing to do . ' 
2437 At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady </ENAMEX>issued a statement minimizing the stock market ' s drop . 
2525 ` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today </TIMEX>' s stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy , ' he said . 
2636 ` The economy remains well - balanced , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . ' 
2725 But administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>conceded that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s drop carried the chance of further declines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>. 
2832 ` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>possibility is that this is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its breadth , and not a major problem , ' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>senior administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>, who also asked that he not be named . 
3024 ` The other is that we see another major disaster , like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>. 
3094 I think that ' s less likely . ' 
3125 Nevertheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Johnson </ENAMEX>were in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening </TIMEX>, monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world . 
3297 The action was expected to begin with the opening of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand </ENAMEX>foreign exchange markets at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 p . m . EST </TIMEX>- - when stocks there plunged - - and to continue as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the trading day </TIMEX>began later in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening </TIMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>and through early <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning </TIMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>. 
3550 Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>planned to keep market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rooms </ENAMEX>operating throughout <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night </TIMEX>to monitor the developments . 
3669 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>, share prices dropped sharply by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 7 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early Monday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning </TIMEX>trading . 
3749 After the initial slide , the market appeared to be turning around but by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early afternoon </TIMEX>was headed lower . 
3858 In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>, the lead is being taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Undersecretary </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Glauber </ENAMEX>and Assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullins </ENAMEX>. 
4002 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men </ENAMEX>worked together on the so - called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Brady Commission </ENAMEX>, headed by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady </ENAMEX>, which was established after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash to examine the market ' s collapse . 
4165 As a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets , and financial market crises . 
4260 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady </ENAMEX>was at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>when the stock market ' s decline began . 
4349 He was quickly on the phone with Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullins </ENAMEX>, who in turn was talking with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairmen </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>. 
4476 Later , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady </ENAMEX>phoned Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden </ENAMEX>and numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>and overseas . 
4592 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Aides </ENAMEX>say he continued to work the phones through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>. 
4657 Administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>was briefed throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening </TIMEX>, even after leaving for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Camp David </ENAMEX>. 
4789 He had frequent telephone consultations with Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Boskin </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">counsel </ENAMEX>of economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers </ENAMEX>. 
4912 Government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>tried throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>to render a business - as - usual appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic . 
5041 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Undersecretary </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Mulford </ENAMEX>, for instance , was at a meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Business Council </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hot Springs </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va . </ENAMEX>, when the stock market fell , and remained there through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the following day </TIMEX>. 
5230 And as of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan </ENAMEX>had n't canceled his plans to address the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Bankers Association </ENAMEX>convention in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 a . m . this morning </TIMEX>. 
5397 Ironically , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan </ENAMEX>was scheduled to address the same convention in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas </ENAMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 20 , 1987 </TIMEX>. 
5496 He flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas </ENAMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 19 </TIMEX>, when the market plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508 </NUMEX>points , but then turned around the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">next morning </TIMEX>and returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>without delivering his speech .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce </ENAMEX>said it will increase its loan - loss provisions to cover all its loans to lesser developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>, except <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico </ENAMEX>, resulting in an after - tax charge to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">300 million Canadian dollars </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US $ 255 million </NUMEX>-RRB- . 
262 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Bowder </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountant </ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>' s strong earnings enable it to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>to set aside provisions covering all its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C $ 1 . 17 billion </NUMEX>in non - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican </ENAMEX>LDC debt . 
479 ` It eliminates the continuing uncertainty with respect to the ultimate value of the loans , ' he said . 
582 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>said <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about C $ 525 million </NUMEX>will be added to its existing LDC and general loss provisions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its fourth quarter </TIMEX>, ending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 31 </TIMEX>. 
717 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowder </ENAMEX>said the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C $ 300 million </NUMEX>charge to earnings would amount to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about C $ 1 . 34 </NUMEX>a share . 
808 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>' s net income for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months ended July 31 </TIMEX>was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C $ 577 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C $ 3 . 10 </NUMEX>a share . 
904 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowder </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>will restructure its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C $ 604 million </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican </ENAMEX>debt , of which <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C $ 255 million </NUMEX>is in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican </ENAMEX>notes secured by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>government bonds . 
1058 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>has a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 % </NUMEX>reserve against the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C $ 349 million </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican </ENAMEX>debt and expects to swap that for other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican </ENAMEX>notes supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . S . Treasury </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero </NUMEX>- coupon bonds . 
1234 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowder </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>' s experience with LDC debt has been ` painful ' and this latest move represents the final phase of a program begun <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">seven years ago </TIMEX>to reduce its exposure through provisioning , debt sales and debt swaps . 
1460 He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>will no longer participate in LDC sovereign lending , but will support trade financing and other transactions that meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>' s standards .  

9 Striking auto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>ended their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">19 - day </TIMEX>occupation of a metal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shop </ENAMEX>at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Peugeot S . A . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factory </ENAMEX>in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>as pay talks got under way in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">capital </ENAMEX>. 
173 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Peugeot </ENAMEX>breakthrough came as a nationwide dispute by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance Ministry </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>disrupted border checkpoints and threatened the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>' s ability to pay its bills . 
350 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Peugeot </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">metalworkers </ENAMEX>began filing out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shop </ENAMEX>, which makes auto parts , at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mulhouse </ENAMEX>after voting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">589 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">193 </NUMEX>to abandon the occupation . 
507 Their withdrawal was based on promises by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Peugeot </ENAMEX>to open negotiations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris </ENAMEX>at the same time the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>left the premises . 
638 The strike by customs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers </ENAMEX>, tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors </ENAMEX>, treasury <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>and other civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants </ENAMEX>attached to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ministry of Finance </ENAMEX>may pose a more serious challenge to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>and the average <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Frenchman </ENAMEX>. 
843 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ministry </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>complain that they are poorly paid because of a complex job - rating system they say fails to take into account their education and level of technical expertise .  

9 Proposals for government - operated ` national service , ' like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza </ENAMEX>, flare up from time to time , depress the resistance of the body politic , run their course , and seem to disappear , only to mutate and afflict public life anew . 
239 The disease metaphor comes to mind , of course , not as an aspersion on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates </ENAMEX>of national service . 
344 Rather , it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought had been eliminated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1970s </TIMEX>, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox </ENAMEX>. 
526 It is back with us again , in the form of legislation to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers </ENAMEX>under a ` National and Community Service Act , ' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall </TIMEX>. 
712 Why does the national - service <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus </ENAMEX>keep coming back ? 
766 Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel . 
861 If only we could get <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America </ENAMEX>' s wastrel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth </ENAMEX>into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self - discipline again and revive the spirit of giving . 
1021 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A quarter of a century ago </TIMEX>national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft - - by , of all things , expanding the draft . 
1177 Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>that an obligation of government service for all young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>is still the true long - term aim of many national - service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backers </ENAMEX>, despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion . 
1423 Choice of the volunteer military in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s </TIMEX>seemed to doom national service as much as the draft . 
1523 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus </ENAMEX>was kept alive in sociology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">departments </ENAMEX>until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a couple of years ago </TIMEX>, when it again was let loose . 
1635 This time it attempted to invade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>of educational grants and loans . 
1810 Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates </ENAMEX>reasoned , but require some form of service from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient </ENAMEX>? 
1939 Military service , moreover , could be a national - service option . 
2005 Thus , undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious , infecting patriotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives </ENAMEX>, pay - as - you - go <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moderates </ENAMEX>, and idealistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals </ENAMEX>. 
2185 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Democratic Leadership Council </ENAMEX>, a centrist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group </ENAMEX>sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party </ENAMEX>to attract support , especially among college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students </ENAMEX>and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents </ENAMEX>. 
2370 A provision allowing grants to be applied to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>- home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling . 
2500 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">DLC </ENAMEX>plan envisaged ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers </ENAMEX>' planting <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees </ENAMEX>, emptying bedpans , tutoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children </ENAMEX>, and assisting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarians </ENAMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 </NUMEX>a week , tax free , plus medical care . 
2660 With a tax - free <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 , 000 </NUMEX>voucher payment at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of each year </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers </ENAMEX>would be making a wage comparable to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 , 500 </NUMEX>a year . 
2793 Mind you , most of ` the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers </ENAMEX>' would be unskilled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">17 - to 18 - year - olds </TIMEX>, some not even high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates </ENAMEX>, and many saving money by living at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home </ENAMEX>. 
2946 They would be doing better financially under national service than many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers </ENAMEX>working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families </ENAMEX>. 
3097 As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the national - service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">devotees </ENAMEX>decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of ` give in order to get . ' 
3347 Opposition to national service from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon </ENAMEX>, which wants to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military - service option being dropped . 
3506 Clearly , a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up . 
3573 What better place to turn than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kennedy </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Committee </ENAMEX>, that great stove of government expansionism , where many a stagnant pot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">porridge </ENAMEX>is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cuisine </ENAMEX>? 
3822 In this case , the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid -LRB- particularly satisfying to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">DLC </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Nunn </ENAMEX>-RRB- , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation -LRB- a la <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Dodd </ENAMEX>-RRB- , a competitive grants program to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects -LRB- a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy </ENAMEX>specialty -RRB- , a community service work - study program for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students </ENAMEX>-LRB- pleasing to the palate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Bumpers </ENAMEX>, among others -RRB- , plus engorgement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">VISTA </ENAMEX>volunteer program and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Retired Senior Volunteer </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Foster Grandparent </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Senior Companion </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">programs </ENAMEX>. 
4485 Before the menu is printed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>may add more ingredients , also changing the initial price , now posted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 330 million </NUMEX>. 
4617 It is widely known that ` too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks </ENAMEX>spoil the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">broth </ENAMEX>, ' but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks </ENAMEX>, especially if they are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators </ENAMEX>. 
4776 The ` omnibus ' bill coming out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>may be unwholesome glop , but the assorted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chefs </ENAMEX>are happy and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">restaurant </ENAMEX>is pushing the dish very hard . 
4926 The aroma of patronage is in the air . 
4966 Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ? 
5041 On the contrary , it is as robust as ever . 
5083 According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Gallup Poll </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults </ENAMEX>contribute an average of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours </TIMEX>a week of service , while financial contributions to charity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s </TIMEX>have risen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % </NUMEX>-LRB- adjusted for inflation -RRB- . 
5280 Even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>does see various ` unmet needs , ' national service is not the way to meet them . 
5377 If we want to support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students </ENAMEX>, we might adopt the idea used in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>of offering more scholarships based on something called ` scholarship , ' rather than on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>' s idea of ` service . ' 
5579 Or we might provide a tax credit for working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students </ENAMEX>. 
5634 What we do not need to do is start a war , and then try to justify it by creating a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI Bill </ENAMEX>. 
5728 To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial jobs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospitals </ENAMEX>, for example , we should raise pay , pursue labor - saving technology , or allow more legal immigration , rather than overpay high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates </ENAMEX>as short - term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>and cause resentment among permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs . 
6045 Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ? 
6161 Not necessarily . 
6178 Polls show wide , generalized support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing . 
6321 Nonetheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats </ENAMEX>are organizing a roll of supporting ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">associations </ENAMEX>, ' ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">societies </ENAMEX>' and ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">councils </ENAMEX>, ' some of which may hope to receive the paid ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers </ENAMEX>. ' 
6490 So far , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>seems ill - disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free - standing proposal to endow a ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Points of Light </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">foundation </ENAMEX>with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 million </NUMEX>to inform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens </ENAMEX>of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism . 
6730 However , even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House </ENAMEX>gives in to congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic </ENAMEX>pressure to add to the scope of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>' s initiative or to involve the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">foundation </ENAMEX>in ` brokering ' federal funds for volunteer projects . 
7002 There ' s no need for such concessions . 
7040 The omnibus can be defeated , the virus controlled , and real service protected . 
7119 National service , the utopian idea , still wo n't go away then , of course , but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the millions </NUMEX>of knee - socked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth </ENAMEX>performing works of ` civic content ' will be mobilized only in the imagination of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors </ENAMEX>. 
7332 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapman </ENAMEX>is a fellow at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Indianapolis </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Hudson Institute </ENAMEX>. 
7400 This article is adapted from remarks at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Hoover Institution </ENAMEX>conference on national service , in which Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Szanton </ENAMEX>also participated .  

9 A federal appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX>ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>ca n't hold corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media concurrently revealed substantial information about the product ' s flaws . 
249 The ruling stems from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984 </TIMEX>suit filed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer Inc . </ENAMEX>, claiming that company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>misled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>about the expected success of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lisa </ENAMEX>computer , introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983 </TIMEX>. 
449 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers </ENAMEX>specializing in shareholder suits said they are concerned that use of the ` press defense ' by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>may become popular as a result of the ruling . 
611 According to the suit , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>created public excitement by touting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lisa </ENAMEX>as an office computer that would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">first year </TIMEX>. 
800 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs </ENAMEX>also alleged that prior to the fanfare , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>circulated internal memos indicating problems with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lisa </ENAMEX>. 
926 The suit claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>' s stock climbed to a high of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 63 . 50 </NUMEX>a share on the basis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s optimistic forecasts . 
1045 But when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>revealed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lisa </ENAMEX>' s poor sales late in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983 </TIMEX>, the stock plummeted to a low of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 . 37 </NUMEX>a share , according to the suit . 
1178 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>claimed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 150 million </NUMEX>in losses . 
1239 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX>district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently counterbalanced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s statements by alerting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lisa </ENAMEX>' s problems . 
1436 Late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>, the appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>agreed that most of the case should be dismissed . 
1521 However , it gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>the right to pursue a small portion of their claim that pertains to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lisa </ENAMEX>' s disk drive , known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Twiggy </ENAMEX>. 
1659 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>ruled that the news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">media </ENAMEX>did n't reveal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Twiggy </ENAMEX>' s problems at the time . 
1742 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers </ENAMEX>are worried about the ruling ' s implication in other shareholder suits but pointed out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>stressed that the ruling should be regarded as very specific to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>case . 
1933 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>was careful to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles and received the same attention as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s statements , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Grannon </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Greenfield &amp; Chimicles </ENAMEX>, which was n't involved in the case . 
2206 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>is saying that the adverse facts have to be transferred to the market with equal intensity and credibility as the statements of corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders </ENAMEX>. ' 
2368 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shareholders </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Milberg , Weiss , Bershad , Specthrie &amp; Lerach </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>petitioned for a rehearing of the case . 
2510 They wrote : ` The opinion establishes a new rule of immunity - - that if a wide variety of opinions on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s business are publicly reported , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>can say anything without fear of securities liability . ' 
2725 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL </ENAMEX>ORDERED to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 5 million </NUMEX>in legal fees to defunct 
2784 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Football League </ENAMEX>is considering appealing the ruling stemming from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">U . S . Football League </ENAMEX>' s largely unsuccessful antitrust suit against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL </ENAMEX>. 
2945 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>agreed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">USFL </ENAMEX>' s claims that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL </ENAMEX>monopolized major league <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football </ENAMEX>. 
3038 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury </ENAMEX>awarded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">USFL </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 1 </NUMEX>in damages , trebled because of the antitrust claims . 
3131 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . S . Court of Appeals </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>upheld a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 5 million </NUMEX>award of attorneys fees to the defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">league </ENAMEX>. 
3249 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey D . Myerson </ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Myerson &amp; Kuhn </ENAMEX>, then of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Finley , Kumble , Wagner , Heine , Underberg , Manley , Myerson &amp; Casey </ENAMEX>, was the lead trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer </ENAMEX>, and his new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>pursued the application appeal . 
3438 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas R . Pappas </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Myerson &amp; Kuhn </ENAMEX>says <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 5 . 3 million </NUMEX>of the award goes directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">USFL </ENAMEX>to reimburse it for fees already paid . 
3576 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Myerson &amp; Kuhn </ENAMEX>will get <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 260 , 000 </NUMEX>for the costs of pressing the application . 
3660 The federal appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>held that the nominal damages and the failure to prove all claims did n't exclude the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">USFL </ENAMEX>from being reimbursed . 
3799 Antitrust laws provide that injured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">parties </ENAMEX>may be reimbursed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers </ENAMEX>' fees . 
3882 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shepard Goldfein </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL </ENAMEX>, says his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">client </ENAMEX>will consider asking for another hearing or appealing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court </ENAMEX>. 
4026 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldfein </ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher &amp; Flom </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>, says the ruling is wrong and the fee award is excessive because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">USFL </ENAMEX>lost its major claims , including its contention that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL </ENAMEX>restrained trade through television contracts . 
4276 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">USFL </ENAMEX>was not the prevailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">party </ENAMEX>, ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldfein </ENAMEX>insists . 
4341 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">HOUSTON </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">CALGARY </ENAMEX>ALLIANCE : 
4367 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fulbright &amp; Jaworski </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fenerty , Robertson , Fraser &amp; Hatch </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Calgary </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alberta </ENAMEX>, are affiliating to help serve their energy - industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients </ENAMEX>. 
4520 The affiliation is believed to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>such cross - border arrangement among major law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>. 
4617 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>are n't required to refer work exclusively to each other and remain separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organizations </ENAMEX>. 
4718 But they will work together on energy - , environmental - and fair - trade - related issues and conduct seminars on topics of mutual interest , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gibson Gayle Jr . </ENAMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">585 </NUMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fulbright &amp; Jaworski </ENAMEX>. 
4912 In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fulbright &amp; Jaworski </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D . C . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>will play a key role as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>work together on regulatory issues , particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">natural - gas </ENAMEX>exports , for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients </ENAMEX>. 
5096 The arrangement , reached after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about eight months </TIMEX>of negotiations , grew out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 </NUMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fenerty Robertson </ENAMEX>' s desire to develop ties with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U .

5357 IN WHAT MAY SIGNAL a turnaround for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">asbestos </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">W .

5564 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Mount Lebanon High School </ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh </ENAMEX>, sought <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21 million </NUMEX>in compensatory damages from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grace </ENAMEX>, arguing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">asbestos </ENAMEX>, which can cause respiratory diseases and lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer </ENAMEX>, posed a risk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students </ENAMEX>. 
5770 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grace </ENAMEX>successfully contended that removing the fire <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">retardant </ENAMEX>would pose a greater health risk than leaving it alone . 
5888 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said the verdict is thought to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>in favor of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">asbestos </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer </ENAMEX>where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">plaintiff </ENAMEX>was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">asbestos </ENAMEX>in question was used for fireproofing .

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed Financial Corp . </ENAMEX>said it expects to report a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 125 million to $ 150 million </NUMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>. 
132 In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier </TIMEX>period , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed </ENAMEX>had net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 485 , 000 </NUMEX>, but no per - share earnings . 
225 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Atherton </ENAMEX>, said the loss stems from several factors . 
331 He said nonperforming assets rose to slightly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 700 million </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 516 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">between June and September </TIMEX>. 
446 <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 85 % </NUMEX>of the total consisted of nonperforming commercial real estate assets . 
535 Accordingly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed </ENAMEX>estimated that it will provide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 85 million and $ 110 million </NUMEX>for credit losses in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>. 
666 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed </ENAMEX>added that significant additional loan - loss provisions may be required by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>as part of the current <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">City Federal Savings Bank </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed </ENAMEX>' s primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Somerset </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . J .  
893 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">City Federal </ENAMEX>operates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105 </NUMEX>banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>. 
964 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atherton </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed </ENAMEX>will also mark its portfolio of high - yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>divest themselves of such bonds . 
1163 That action , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed </ENAMEX>said , will result in a charge against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>results of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $ 30 million </NUMEX>. 
1276 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed </ENAMEX>also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan origination operations outside its principal markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>and , as a result , is taking a charge for discontinued operations . 
1488 All these actions , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atherton </ENAMEX>said , will result in a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 125 million to $ 150 million </NUMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>. 
1603 He added , however : ` Depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages servicing and the outcome of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">City Federal </ENAMEX>currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves , the total loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>could significantly exceed this range .  

9 Ripples from the strike by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists </ENAMEX>union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing Co . </ENAMEX>reached air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">America West Airlines </ENAMEX>announced it will postpone its new service out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>because of delays in receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft </ENAMEX>from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seattle </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">jet </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>. 
268 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Otradovec </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>for planning at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier </ENAMEX>, said in an interview that the work stoppage at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>, now entering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its 13th day </TIMEX>, ` has caused some turmoil in our scheduling ' and that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 500 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers </ENAMEX>who were booked to fly out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">America West </ENAMEX>would now be put on other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines </ENAMEX>. 
597 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otradovec </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">America West </ENAMEX>that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">757 </ENAMEX>it was supposed to get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this Thursday </TIMEX>would n't be delivered until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov . 7 </TIMEX>- - <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day </TIMEX>after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline </ENAMEX>had been planning to initiate service at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">four daily </TIMEX>flights , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>nonstops to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix </ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>nonstop to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas </ENAMEX>. 
895 Now , those routes are n't expected to begin until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan </TIMEX>. 
951 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>is also supposed to send to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">America West </ENAMEX>another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">757 </ENAMEX>twin - engine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft </ENAMEX>as well as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">737 </ENAMEX>by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year ' s end </TIMEX>. 
1064 Those , too , are almost certain to arrive late . 
1113 At this point , no other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">America West </ENAMEX>flights - - including its new service at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Antonio </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newark </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . J . </ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Palmdale </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>- - have been affected by the delays in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>deliveries . 
1305 Nevertheless , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s reaction underscores the domino effect that a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer </ENAMEX>such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>can have on other parts of the economy . 
1452 It also is sure to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists </ENAMEX>put added pressure on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
1528 ` I just do n't feel that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout , ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Baker </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">District 751 </ENAMEX>, said in an interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
1699 ` I do n't think their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">customers </ENAMEX>would like it very much . ' 
1758 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">America West </ENAMEX>, though , is a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline </ENAMEX>and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">plane </ENAMEX>than many of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>would be . 
1910 ` I figure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United </ENAMEX>probably have such a hard time counting all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">planes </ENAMEX>in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">fleets </ENAMEX>, they might not miss <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>at all , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otradovec </ENAMEX>said . 
2072 Indeed , a random check <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations . 
2200 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southwest Airlines </ENAMEX>has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">737 - 300 </TIMEX>set for delivery at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of this month </TIMEX>and expects to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">plane </ENAMEX>on time . 
2321 ` It ' s so close to completion , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>' s told us there wo n't be a problem , ' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southwest </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>. 
2425 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp . </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>has assured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines </ENAMEX>it will deliver a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">757 </ENAMEX>on time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this month </TIMEX>. 
2541 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American </ENAMEX>is preparing to take delivery of another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">757 </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early December </TIMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 </NUMEX>more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable . 
2691 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seattle </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>explained that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>has been in constant communication with all of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">customers </ENAMEX>and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike . 
2909 Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors </ENAMEX>and non - striking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>have been trying to finish <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 40 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft </ENAMEX>- - mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">747 </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">767 </ENAMEX>jumbo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">jets </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Everett </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wash . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>- - that were all but completed before the walkout . 
3126 As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>had been delivered and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">plane </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">747 - 400 </ENAMEX>, was supposed to be flown out over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Air China </ENAMEX>. 
3256 No date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table . 
3318 ` We want to make sure they know what they want before they come back , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Hammond </ENAMEX>, the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator </ENAMEX>who has been in contact with both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">sides </ENAMEX>since the strike began . 
3495 The investment community , for one , has been anticipating a speedy resolution . 
3573 Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>' s stock price was battered along with the rest of the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, it actually has risen over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the last two weeks </TIMEX>on the strength of new orders . 
3733 ` The market has taken <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>views : that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>in the long term , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Rubel </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cyrus J .

3943 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>' s shares fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57 . 375 </NUMEX>in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>. 
4049 But Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker </ENAMEX>said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of this month </TIMEX>, hinting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union </ENAMEX>may resume negotiations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as early as this week </TIMEX>. 
4228 Still , he said , it ' s possible that the strike could last considerably longer . 
4306 ` I would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything . ' 
4365 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Shrontz </ENAMEX>sent striking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>a letter , saying that ` to my knowledge , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>' s offer represents the best overall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three - year </TIMEX>contract of any major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>in recent history . ' 
4587 But Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker </ENAMEX>called the letter - - and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s offer of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>wage increase over the life of the pact , plus bonuses - - ` very weak . ' 
4725 He added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>miscalculated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union </ENAMEX>' s resolve and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>' disgust with being forced to work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">many hours overtime </TIMEX>. 
4859 In separate developments : - - Talks have broken off between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed Corp . </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Calabasas </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, aerospace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
5011 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union </ENAMEX>is continuing to work through its expired contract , however . 
5082 It had planned a strike vote for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Sunday </TIMEX>, but that has been pushed back indefinitely . 
5174 - - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Auto Workers Local 1069 </ENAMEX>, which represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>' s helicopter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Delaware County </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa . </ENAMEX>, said it agreed to extend its contract on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day </TIMEX>- by - <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day </TIMEX>basis , with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 - day </TIMEX>notification to cancel , while it continues bargaining . 
5423 The accord expired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
5455 - - And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>said it received an order from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Martinair Holland </ENAMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">767 - 300 </ENAMEX>wide - body <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">jetliners </ENAMEX>valued at a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 326 million </NUMEX>.

5827 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman </ENAMEX>said a delivery date for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">planes </ENAMEX>is still being worked out ` for a variety of reasons , but not because of the strike . '

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hammond Co . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport Beach </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity National Financial Inc . </ENAMEX>extended its previous agreement , under which it wo n't purchase any more of the mortgage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banker </ENAMEX>' s common stock , through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 31 </TIMEX>. 
213 The previous agreement expired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday </TIMEX>. 
256 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hammond </ENAMEX>said that its discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Irvine </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, title - insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriter </ENAMEX>, are continuing , but that prospects for a longer - term standstill agreement are uncertain .

516 Statements made in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission </ENAMEX>filings led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hammond </ENAMEX>to request a standstill agreement .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Common Cause </ENAMEX>asked both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Ethics Committee </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department </ENAMEX>to investigate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million </NUMEX>in political gifts by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Keating </ENAMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U .

252 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>is currently the subject of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 1 billion </NUMEX>federal anti - racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>he controlled , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association </ENAMEX>, and driving it into insolvency .

817 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wertheimer </ENAMEX>based this on a statement by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>that was quoted in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wall Street Journal </ENAMEX>story in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April </TIMEX>: ` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>question . . . had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures </ENAMEX>to take up my cause . 
1063 I want to say in the most forceful way I can : I certainly hope so . ' 
1133 In a highly unusual meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeConcini </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1987 </TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators </ENAMEX>asked federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>to ease up on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln </ENAMEX>. 
1269 According to notes taken by one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants </ENAMEX>at the meeting , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln </ENAMEX>was gambling dangerously with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">depositors </ENAMEX>' federally insured money and was ` a ticking time bomb . ' 
1462 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>had complained that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>were being too zealous . 
1535 The notes show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeConcini </ENAMEX>called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Home Loan Bank Board </ENAMEX>' s regulations ` grossly unfair , ' and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn </ENAMEX>insisted that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>was ` viable and profitable . ' 
1728 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next two years </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Bank Board </ENAMEX>, which at the time was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency </ENAMEX>responsible for regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts </ENAMEX>, failed to act - - even after federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors </ENAMEX>warned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 1987 </TIMEX>that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>had caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln </ENAMEX>to become insolvent . 
1958 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln </ENAMEX>' s parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Continental Corp . </ENAMEX>, entered bankruptcy - law proceedings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this April 13 </TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>seized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next day </TIMEX>. 
2109 The newly formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Resolution Trust Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">successor </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Bank Board </ENAMEX>, filed suit against Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>and several others on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 15 </TIMEX>. 
2244 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>has filed his own suit , alleging that his property was taken illegally . 
2330 The cost to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln </ENAMEX>' s collapse has been estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 2 . 5 billion </NUMEX>. 
2423 Details of the affair have become public gradually over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two years </TIMEX>, mostly as a result of reporting by several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>. 
2554 In the midst of his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>re - election campaign , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riegle </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Banking Committee </ENAMEX>, returned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 76 , 000 </NUMEX>in contributions after a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper </ENAMEX>said that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>had gathered the money for him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">about two weeks </TIMEX>before the meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>. 
2823 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeConcini </ENAMEX>, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months </TIMEX>of fending off intense press criticism , returned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 48 , 000 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">only last month </TIMEX>, shortly after the government formally accused Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>of defrauding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln </ENAMEX>. 
3009 In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>disclosed that he belatedly had paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13 , 433 </NUMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Continental </ENAMEX>as reimbursement for trips he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family </ENAMEX>took aboard the corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">jet </ENAMEX>to Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>' s vacation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cat Cay </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Bahamas </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">from 1984 through 1986 </TIMEX>. 
3268 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain </ENAMEX>said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter ` fell between the cracks . ' 
3380 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>, his family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates </ENAMEX>also donated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 112 , 000 </NUMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain </ENAMEX>' s congressional campaigns over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years </TIMEX>, according to press accounts . 
3535 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain </ENAMEX>says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>broke off their friendship abruptly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator </ENAMEX>refused to press the thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>' s case as vigorously as Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>wanted . 
3715 ` He became very angry at that , left my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office </ENAMEX>and told a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>that I was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wimp </ENAMEX>, ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain </ENAMEX>recalls . 
3832 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>disclosed that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>gave <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 850 , 000 </NUMEX>in corporate funds to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>tax - exempt voter registration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">organizations </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>at the behest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston </ENAMEX>, who conceded that soliciting the money was ` a pretty stupid thing to do politically . ' 
4111 In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston </ENAMEX>received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 47 , 000 </NUMEX>in campaign donations through Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party </ENAMEX>received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 85 , 000 </NUMEX>in corporate donations for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>get - out - the - vote drive that benefited the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator </ENAMEX>' s re - election campaign <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that year </TIMEX>. 
4371 Also in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>disclosed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 , 000 </NUMEX>in corporate donations by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Council on Public Policy </ENAMEX>, a political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee </ENAMEX>controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn </ENAMEX>. 
4548 That was in addition to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 34 , 000 </NUMEX>in direct campaign donations arranged by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator </ENAMEX>. 
4656 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wertheimer </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Ethics Committee </ENAMEX>should hire a special outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel </ENAMEX>to conduct an investigation , as was done in the case of former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wright </ENAMEX>. 
4833 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson Abney </ENAMEX>, staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of the ethics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel </ENAMEX>, would n't comment . 
4903 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riegle </ENAMEX>said he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had been ` entirely proper . ' 
5006 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain </ENAMEX>said he had been ` deeply concerned ' at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper , but decided it was ` entirely appropriate ' for him to seek fair treatment for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent </ENAMEX>. 
5210 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn </ENAMEX>said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and ` I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Ethics Committee </ENAMEX>. ' 
5395 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeConcini </ENAMEX>said , ` When all is said and done , I expect to be fully exonerated . ' 
5480 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston </ENAMEX>, who had already volunteered his help to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Bureau of Investigation </ENAMEX>in any investigation of Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>, portrayed his role in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>as prodding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>to act . 
5666 ` Why did n't the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Bank Board </ENAMEX>act sooner ? ' he said . 
5715 ` That is what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Common Cause </ENAMEX>should ask be investigated .  

9 The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>major event <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning </TIMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>stock and futures trading may be a pause at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange </ENAMEX>. 
131 Under a reform arising from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash , trading in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc </ENAMEX>' s stock - index futures will break for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes </TIMEX>if the contract opens and stays <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>points from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s close , a move equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 </NUMEX>points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average . 
371 The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>, which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc </ENAMEX>. 
523 That <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early - morning </TIMEX>breather is just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of a number of safeguards adopted after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash . 
619 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading volume . 
703 Several of those post - crash changes kicked in during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one - hour </TIMEX>collapse and worked as expected , even though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge . 
858 But the major ` circuit breakers ' have yet to be evaluated . 
917 A deeper market plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>could give them their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>test . 
982 A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed - - but not implemented - - after the last crash . 
1127 Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Brady Task Force </ENAMEX>, which analyzed the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash , would be revived - - especially because that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">group </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>is now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>. 
1333 The most controversial of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady </ENAMEX>recommendations involved establishing a single overarching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator </ENAMEX>to handle crucial cross - market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets . 
1564 But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants </ENAMEX>said the circuit breakers worked as intended . 
1728 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>expressed satisfaction with the results of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>limits imposed on of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 </NUMEX>contract , as well as ` hot - line ' communications among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>. 
1922 Those pauses - - <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 2 : 07 p . m . to 2 : 30 p . m . CDT </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 2 : 45 p . m . until the close of trading a half - hour later </TIMEX>- - forced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels . 
2129 During the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>halt , after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>index had fallen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 </NUMEX>points , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Sidecar </ENAMEX>' computer program automatically was triggered . 
2266 That system is designed to separate computer - generated program trades from all other trades to help exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>resolve order imbalances in individual stocks . 
2434 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker </ENAMEX>compared the action in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>pit during the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>freezes to a fire at a well - drilled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school </ENAMEX>. 
2544 ` You do n't want the fire but you know what to do , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Dubnow </ENAMEX>, an independent floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker </ENAMEX>and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor </ENAMEX>. 
2664 ` There was no panic . 
2685 The system worked the way we devised it to work . ' 
2737 After reopening for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 15 minutes </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>index tumbled to its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 </NUMEX>- point limit and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>freeze went into effect . 
2859 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>then spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last half - hour </TIMEX>` watching to see if the Dow would drop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250 </NUMEX>points , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dubnow </ENAMEX>added , referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour </TIMEX>. 
3054 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer </ENAMEX>estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 % to 90 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>` were just standing around watching . ' 
3152 But the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250 </NUMEX>- point circuit breaker never had to kick in , and freezes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade </ENAMEX>' s Major Market Index also were n't triggered . 
3295 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">MMI </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 </NUMEX>are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>major indexes used by program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>to run their computerized trading strategies . 
3415 The programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash . 
3492 The process of post - crash reforms began with calls to remake the markets and wound up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year later </TIMEX>with a series of rather technical adjustments . 
3640 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>, just after the market drop , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated . 
3797 Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next year </TIMEX>that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players </ENAMEX>time to pause and reconsider positions . 
3986 In addition , limits were placed on computer - driven trading , and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets . 
4113 Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated . 
4175 At the outset the prime target was program trading , which was much discussed but little understood on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill </ENAMEX>. 
4291 There were also calls to strip the stock markets of ` derivative ' products , such as stock - index futures and options , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Sporkin </ENAMEX>, for example , likened to ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">barnacles </ENAMEX>attached to the basic market . ' 
4510 And there was much criticism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>' s system of having stock trades flow through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists </ENAMEX>, or market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>. 
4648 When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Brady Task Force </ENAMEX>' s powerful analysis of the crash was released in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1988 </TIMEX>, it immediately reshaped the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers </ENAMEX>' agenda . 
4784 Arguing that the separate financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">marketplaces </ENAMEX>acted as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>, and concluding that the crash had ` raised the possibility of a full - scale financial system breakdown , ' the presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">task force </ENAMEX>called for establishing a super - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulator </ENAMEX>to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers . 
5148 Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented . 
5209 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House </ENAMEX>held the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady </ENAMEX>recommendations at arm ' s length and named a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel </ENAMEX>- - the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Working Group on the Financial Markets </ENAMEX>- - to review its analysis and those of other crash studies . 
5410 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 1988 </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Working Group </ENAMEX>, made up of representatives from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission </ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commodity Futures Trading Commission </ENAMEX>, finally endorsed only circuit breakers . 
5637 After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several more months </TIMEX>of arguments among various stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges </ENAMEX>and futures markets , circuit breakers were set in place , with the most notable suspending trading after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250 </NUMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400 </NUMEX>point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . 
5871 Privately , some free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marketeers </ENAMEX>dismissed such mechanisms as sops to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interventionists </ENAMEX>. 
5958 After all , this free - market argument went , the Dow only dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 250 </NUMEX>points once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">this century </TIMEX>. 
6064 ` Circuit breakers ' set to soften big drops : 
6110 - - If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>futures fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 </NUMEX>points at opening , contract trading pauses for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes </TIMEX>. 
6196 - - If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Industrials </ENAMEX>fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 </NUMEX>points at opening , contract trading pauses for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes </TIMEX>. 
6287 - - If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>futures fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 </NUMEX>points -LRB- equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100 </NUMEX>points on DJIA -RRB- , trading is frozen for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half hour </TIMEX>to that price or higher . 
6419 On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NYSE </ENAMEX>program trades are diverted into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell orders . 
6521 - - If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>futures fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 </NUMEX>points , trading is restricted for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour </TIMEX>to that price or higher . 
6616 - - If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Industrials </ENAMEX>fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250 </NUMEX>points , trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>halts for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour </TIMEX>. 
6699 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">MMI </ENAMEX>contracts also halt . 
6734 - - If DJIA drops <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400 </NUMEX>points , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>halts trading for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours </TIMEX>. 
6802 Trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">MMI </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>futures also halted . 
6848 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Brady Task Force </ENAMEX>recommendations -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan . 1988 </TIMEX>-RRB- : 
6896 - - Establish an overarching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulator </ENAMEX>for financial markets

7319 - - Give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC </ENAMEX>authority to halt securities trading , -LRB- also opposed by new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>-RRB- . 
7407 Congressional proposal : 
7433 - - Create a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">task force </ENAMEX>to review current state of the securities markets and securities laws . 
7529 Breaking the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>' s television monopoly , an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>has gained rights to show world programming , including <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>films . 
7679 ` There must not be a monopoly , there must be freedom of choice for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers </ENAMEX>, ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikolai I . Lutsenko </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nika TV </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, told the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly </TIMEX>newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nedelya </ENAMEX>. 
7871 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>is already working on its own programming in several provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities </ENAMEX>and hopes to be on the air regularly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about a year </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper </ENAMEX>said . 
8030 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lutsenko </ENAMEX>told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nedelya </ENAMEX>that he recently had been to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U .

8162 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nedelya </ENAMEX>' s article was accompanied by a picture of Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lutsenko </ENAMEX>interviewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Denver </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colorado </ENAMEX>. 
8272 Even though it will be independent of official television , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nika </ENAMEX>will have an oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>that will include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist </ENAMEX>youth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">league </ENAMEX>. 
8424 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Union of Mineworkers </ENAMEX>said that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">diamond </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners </ENAMEX>struck for higher wages at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd .  
8567 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">De Beers </ENAMEX>said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mines </ENAMEX>were on strike , which it said was peaceful , with orderly picketing occurring at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mines </ENAMEX>. 
8721 The deadlock in negotiations occurred with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">De Beers </ENAMEX>offering a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 % </NUMEX>increase in the minimum - wage category while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union </ENAMEX>demanded a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37 . 6 % </NUMEX>increase in the minimum wage . 
8891 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>' s opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Socialist Party </ENAMEX>denied that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators </ENAMEX>had been bribed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">pinball - parlor </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners </ENAMEX>. 
8996 The allegation had been raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parliament </ENAMEX>by the governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Liberal Democratic Party </ENAMEX>following magazine reports suggesting that money from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>- style <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pinball </ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pachinko </ENAMEX>, had infiltrated politics . 
9204 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsuruo Yamaguchi </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary general </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Socialist Party </ENAMEX>, acknowledged that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine </NUMEX>party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers </ENAMEX>had received donations from the pachinko <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association </ENAMEX>totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8 million yen </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 55 , 000 </NUMEX>-RRB- but said the donations were legal and none of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">members </ENAMEX>acted to favor the industry . 
9484 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">World Wide Fund for Nature </ENAMEX>said that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Argentina </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Thailand </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Indonesia </ENAMEX>were doing too little to prevent illegal trade in endangered wildlife across their borders . 
9658 A report by the conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>presented at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . N . </ENAMEX>- sponsored <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lausanne </ENAMEX>accused the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>of trading protected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species </ENAMEX>ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parakeets </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids </ENAMEX>. 
9874 Fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Lyster </ENAMEX>said world trade in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife </ENAMEX>was estimated to total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion </NUMEX>of business <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually </TIMEX>. 
9988 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NATO </ENAMEX>project to build a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">frigate </ENAMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the 1990s </TIMEX>was torpedoed by the pull - out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight </NUMEX>participating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations </ENAMEX>. 
10111 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy </ENAMEX>announced technical reasons for withdrawing , but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>pointed to growing reluctance among the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">allies </ENAMEX>to commit themselves to big defense spending while East - West disarmament talks show signs of success . 
10352 Small wonder that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Labor Party </ENAMEX>wants credit controls . 
10415 <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A few hours </TIMEX>after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party </ENAMEX>launched its own affinity credit card <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Tories </ENAMEX>raised the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s base interest rate . 
10552 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Labor </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Visa </ENAMEX>card is believed to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>linked to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party </ENAMEX>. 
10635 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Labor </ENAMEX>gets <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 pence </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">39 cents </NUMEX>-RRB- for every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 155 </NUMEX>-RRB- that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user </ENAMEX>charges to the card . 
10726 As with other plastic in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>' s high - interest - rate environment , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Labor </ENAMEX>card , administered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Co - operative Bank </ENAMEX>, carries a stiff -LRB- in this case , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29 . 8 % </NUMEX>-RRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>rate on the unpaid balance . 
10919 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">year - long </TIMEX>austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets . 
11148 The official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">China Daily </ENAMEX>said retail prices of non - staple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">foods </ENAMEX>have n't risen since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last December </TIMEX>but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down . 
11337 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Statistical Bureau </ENAMEX>found that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 1 billion yuan </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 270 million </NUMEX>-RRB- was spent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of the year </TIMEX>for pork subsidies . 
11479 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">newspaper </ENAMEX>quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts </ENAMEX>as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to ` become very unreasonable ' and reduce needed funds for investment in the ` already difficult state budget . ' 
11717 The aim of the austerity measures was to slice economic growth , which soared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 . 7 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>. 
11829 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists </ENAMEX>now predict the growth rate will be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 11 . 5 % </NUMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year </TIMEX>. 
11904 In a sign of growing official tolerance for religion , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Russian Orthodox </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests </ENAMEX>were allowed to celebrate the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">400th </NUMEX>anniversary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow </ENAMEX>patriarchate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Kremlin </ENAMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">15th - century </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Uspensky Cathedral </ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">czars </ENAMEX>were crowned . . . . 
12140 A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">34 - foot </NUMEX>- tall , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 . 7 million </NUMEX>statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha </ENAMEX>was completed on a hill outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>, facing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>. 
12243 The statue is the brainchild of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sik Chi Wan </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Po Lin Monastery </ENAMEX>, who said : ` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>is such a prosperous place , we also need some kind of religious symbol .  

9 It was n't so long ago that a radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>- - and originally by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Central Intelligence Agency </ENAMEX>- - was accused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>here of employing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">propagandists </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">imperialists </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies </ENAMEX>. 
218 Now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>has opened a news bureau in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">capital </ENAMEX>. 
288 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees </ENAMEX>held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign : ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Szabad Europa Radio </ENAMEX>' - - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>. 
402 ` I think this is a victory for the radio , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnabas de Bueky </ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">55 - year - old </TIMEX>former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugee </ENAMEX>who works in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Munich </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">headquarters </ENAMEX>as deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">service </ENAMEX>. 
605 In fact , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>hopes to set up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Warsaw </ENAMEX>and anywhere else in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bloc </ENAMEX>that will have it . 
716 But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>' s life in more ways than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>. 
833 In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>is in danger of suffering from its success . 
906 While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>currently can operate freely in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest </ENAMEX>, so can others . 
981 In addition , competition for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners </ENAMEX>is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled . 
1105 Instead of being denounced as an evil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agent </ENAMEX>of imperialism , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame , even boring . 
1267 ` They have a lot to do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">these days </TIMEX>to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX>radio , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Deak </ENAMEX>, a computer - science <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Technical University </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest </ENAMEX>. 
1421 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX>-LCB- radio -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters </ENAMEX>seem better informed and more critical about about what ' s going on here . ' 
1530 Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary </ENAMEX>is in the midst of a media explosion . 
1584 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boys </ENAMEX>on busy street <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">corners </ENAMEX>peddle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>of every political stripe . 
1657 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Newsstands </ENAMEX>are packed with a colorful array of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines </ENAMEX>. 
1715 Radio and television are getting livelier and bolder . 
1771 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Broadcasting Corp . </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice of America </ENAMEX>broadcast over <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX>airwaves , though <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few hours a day </TIMEX>each in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hungarian </ENAMEX>. 
1935 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian </ENAMEX>press magnate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch </ENAMEX>has bought <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX>stakes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>popular and gossipy <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Maxwell </ENAMEX>has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar moves . 
2145 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>does n't plan to fade away . 
2194 With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff </ENAMEX>says it still has plenty to do - - in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary </ENAMEX>and in the ` <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Great Eastern Beyond </ENAMEX>. ' 
2351 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>and its sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">station </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Liberty </ENAMEX>, say they wo n't cut back their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than 19 hours </TIMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX>broadcasts . 
2499 They are still an important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">source </ENAMEX>of news for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 million </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners </ENAMEX>in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 </NUMEX>exotic tongues : from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bulgarian </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Belorussian </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Kazakh </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Kirghiz </ENAMEX>. 
2645 The establishment of its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bureau </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Warsaw Pact </ENAMEX>territory shows the depth of some of the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe </ENAMEX>. 
2766 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Months </TIMEX>before the decision by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Communist Party </ENAMEX>to rename itself <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Socialist </ENAMEX>and try to look more appealing to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers </ENAMEX>were trying to look more hospitable . 
2953 It proved a perfect time for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>to ask for permission to set up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>. 
3042 Not only did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs </ENAMEX>approve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>' s new location , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ministry of Telecommunications </ENAMEX>did something even more amazing : ` They found us <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>phone lines in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest </ENAMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geza Szocs </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent </ENAMEX>who helped organize the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest </ENAMEX>location . 
3359 ` That is a miracle . ' 
3382 It ' s a far cry from the previous treatment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>, which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents </ENAMEX>-LRB- who filed reports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>by phone , secret <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers </ENAMEX>or letters -RRB- . 
3606 In fact , some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners </ENAMEX>say they owe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer </ENAMEX>here calls the ` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dark Ages of the 20th Century </TIMEX>. ' 
3833 ` During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past four years </TIMEX>, many of us have sat up until late at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night </TIMEX>listening to our radios , ' says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer </ENAMEX>. 
3948 ` There were some very brave broadcasts . ' 
3991 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners </ENAMEX>, too , had to be brave . 
4028 Through much of the post - <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II </ENAMEX>period , listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary </ENAMEX>. 
4130 ` When we listen to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">station </ENAMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother </ENAMEX>still gets nervous , ' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator </ENAMEX>. 
4228 ` She wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains . ' 
4290 Now , the toughest competition for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>comes during the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late - night </TIMEX>slot . 
4376 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">radio </ENAMEX>often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight </TIMEX>. 
4467 Television , which most of the time is considered rather tame , has entered the running with a new program , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The End of the Day </ENAMEX>, ' which comes on after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 p . m .   </TIMEX>
4624 It is a talk show with opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>and political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts </ENAMEX>who discuss <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary </ENAMEX>' s domestic problems as well as foreign affairs . 
4756 Those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning </TIMEX>for ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Sunday Journal </ENAMEX>, ' on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hungarian Radio </ENAMEX>. 
4888 The competitive spirit is clearly influencing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>, which is trying to beef up programs . 
4990 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>plans to hire free - lance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters </ENAMEX>to cover the latest happenings in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX>country <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">towns </ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Nagykanizsa </ENAMEX>in the west to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Nyiregyhaza </ENAMEX>in the east . 
5160 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">service </ENAMEX>has a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 - minute </TIMEX>news show called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Newsreel </ENAMEX>, with international and domestic news , plus a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX>news review of opinions from around the world . 
5331 There ' s also a host of new programs , trying to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics . 
5426 A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35 - minute </TIMEX>program called ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The March of Time </ENAMEX>' tries to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world . 
5568 There ' s a program for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women </ENAMEX>and a science show . 
5616 And to attract younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe </ENAMEX>intersperses the latest in Western rock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups </ENAMEX>. 
5716 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Pet Shop Boys </ENAMEX>are big <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest </ENAMEX>. 
5767 ` We are starving for all the news , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deak </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student </ENAMEX>. 
5831 ` Every moment we want to know everything about the world .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">OFFICIALS </ENAMEX>MOVED to head off any repeat of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge in stock prices . 
118 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan </ENAMEX>signaled that the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system to prevent a financial crisis . 
275 Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>also mapped out plans , though they kept their moves quiet to avoid making the financial markets more jittery . 
420 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s sell - off was triggered by the collapse of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>' s buy - out plan and a big rise in producer prices . 
525 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones </ENAMEX>industrials skidded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 . 58 </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2569 . 26 </NUMEX>. 
579 The junk bond market came to a standstill , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bonds soared and the dollar fell . 
673 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>stocks dropped early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>, but by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late morning </TIMEX>were turning around . 
752 The dollar was trading sharply lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>. 
801 Prospects for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>buy - out proposal appear bleak . 
856 Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>refused to back the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 . 79 billion </NUMEX>transaction , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>said it was not from any unwillingness to finance takeovers . 
987 The decision was based solely on problems with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>management - pilot plan , they said . 
1078 The surge in producer prices in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>followed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three months </TIMEX>of declines , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>were divided on whether the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 9 % </NUMEX>jump signaled a severe worsening of inflation . 
1248 Also , retail sales grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 5 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>. 
1291 A capital - gains tax cut was removed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>' s deficit reduction bill , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents </ENAMEX>still hope to enact the cut <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
1423 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>wo n't press for a capital - gains provision in the final deficit bill when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees </ENAMEX>meet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this week </TIMEX>. 
1548 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors </ENAMEX>signaled that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to five </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American </ENAMEX>assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>may close by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid - 1990s </TIMEX>as it tries to cut excess capacity .

S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck </ENAMEX>sales fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 . 6 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early October </TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>sales period of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX>- model <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year </TIMEX>, dragged down by a sharp decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM </ENAMEX>sales . 
1832 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>are entangled in a legal battle over movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Gruber </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters </ENAMEX>. 
1930 The fight could set back <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>' s plans to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>movie business . 
2004 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hooker </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>received a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 409 million </NUMEX>bid for most of its real - estate and shopping - center assets from an investor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>. 
2130 The offer does n't include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bonwit Teller </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B . Altman </ENAMEX>. 
2186 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>strike is starting to affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines </ENAMEX>. 
2236 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">America West </ENAMEX>said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>it will postpone its new service out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>because of delays in receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft </ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing </ENAMEX>. 
2364 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi </ENAMEX>would launch a management buy - out if a hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">suitor </ENAMEX>emerged , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>said . 
2465 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Thomson - CSF </ENAMEX>are nearing a pact to merge guided - missile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions </ENAMEX>. 
2564 New <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>steel - import quotas will give a bigger share to developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations </ENAMEX>that have relatively unsubsidized steel industries . 
2692 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>' s steel quota will be cut significantly .

200 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said the plan was n't adopted in response to any known offers for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quest </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">marketer </ENAMEX>of hospital products .

9 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>sold the deposits of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>savings - and - loan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>, in its first wave of sales of big , sick <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts </ENAMEX>, but low bids prevented the sale of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth </NUMEX>. 
176 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S &amp; Ls </ENAMEX>were sold to large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>, as was the case with most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 </NUMEX>previous transactions initiated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Resolution Trust Corp . </ENAMEX>since it was created in the S &amp; L bailout legislation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two months ago </TIMEX>. 
384 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two </NUMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts </ENAMEX>were sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charlotte </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . C . </ENAMEX>, which has aggressively expanded its markets , particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>. 
534 A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>bought another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX>, in the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC </ENAMEX>transaction with a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank </ENAMEX>. 
625 Under these deals , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC </ENAMEX>sells just the deposits and the healthy assets . 
700 These ` clean - bank ' transactions leave the bulk of bad assets , mostly real estate , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>, to be sold later . 
821 In these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>, for instance , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC </ENAMEX>is stuck with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 51 billion </NUMEX>in bad assets . 
901 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Acquirers </ENAMEX>paid premiums ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 5 % to 3 . 7 % </NUMEX>for the deposits and branch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">systems </ENAMEX>, roughly in line with what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>were expecting . 
1041 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyers </ENAMEX>will also be locked into deposit rates for just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two weeks </TIMEX>, as has been the case with previous deals . 
1153 After that , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyers </ENAMEX>may repudiate the rates paid by the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts </ENAMEX>. 
1228 But it ' s uncertain whether these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions </ENAMEX>will take those steps . 
1297 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>, for example , has been one of the highest rate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">payers </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>market , and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>, rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities . 
1453 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC </ENAMEX>had previously targeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts </ENAMEX>for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines , but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency </ENAMEX>. 
1630 ` These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts </ENAMEX>are beached <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales </ENAMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bert Ely </ENAMEX>, an industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant </ENAMEX>based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Alexandria </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va .  
1729 For example , the delay in selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">People ' s Heritage Savings </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Salina </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kan . </ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 7 billion </NUMEX>in assets , has forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC </ENAMEX>to consider selling off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch </ENAMEX>- by - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch </ENAMEX>, instead of as a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution </ENAMEX>. 
1942 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>continued its foray into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>markets . 
2003 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>will acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">University Federal Savings Association </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>, which had assets of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 8 billion </NUMEX>. 
2104 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Texas National Bank </ENAMEX>will pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC </ENAMEX>a premium of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 129 million </NUMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 5 billion </NUMEX>in deposits . 
2202 As a measure of the depths to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>real estate market has sunk , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC </ENAMEX>will pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 8 billion </NUMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>to take <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million </NUMEX>of bad assets . 
2353 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>also acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freedom Savings &amp; Loan Association </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tampa </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla . </ENAMEX>, which had total assets of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 900 million </NUMEX>. 
2461 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>will pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC </ENAMEX>a premium of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 . 4 million </NUMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 1 billion </NUMEX>in deposits . 
2540 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB </ENAMEX>will also acquire <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 266 million </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freedom </ENAMEX>' s assets from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC </ENAMEX>, which will require <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 875 million </NUMEX>in assistance . 
2659 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Meridian Bancorp Inc . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Reading </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa . </ENAMEX>, will acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hill Financial Savings Association </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Red Hill </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa . </ENAMEX>, which had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 3 billion </NUMEX>in assets . 
2794 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Meridian </ENAMEX>will pay a premium of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 . 5 million </NUMEX>to assume <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion </NUMEX>in deposits .

2971 In the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC </ENAMEX>transaction with a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Royal Trustco Ltd . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toronto </ENAMEX>, will acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific Savings Bank </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Costa Mesa </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, which had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 949 million </NUMEX>in assets . 
3140 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Royal Trustco </ENAMEX>will pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 million </NUMEX>to assume <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 989 million </NUMEX>in deposits . 
3219 It will also purchase <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 473 million </NUMEX>in assets , and receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 550 million </NUMEX>in assistance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC </ENAMEX>.  

9 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>' s steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists , and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market ' s plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
206 After falling for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three consecutive months </TIMEX>, the producer price index for finished goods shot up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 9 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department </ENAMEX>reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, as energy prices jumped after tumbling through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer </TIMEX>. 
418 Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 . 58 </NUMEX>- point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>said it did play a role in the market ' s decline . 
622 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months </TIMEX>, as evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve </ENAMEX>was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>had hoped . 
818 Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>from easing credit , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department </ENAMEX>reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>that retail sales grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 5 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 145 . 21 billion </NUMEX>. 
1029 That rise came on top of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 7 % </NUMEX>gain in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>, and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy . 
1148 ` I think the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>report , combined with the actions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>, weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dederick </ENAMEX>, chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northern Trust Co . </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>. 
1375 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists </ENAMEX>were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers . 
1474 ` The overall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 9 % </NUMEX>increase is serious in itself , but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer price index still increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 7 % </NUMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon Richards </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX>at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Manufacturers </ENAMEX>. 
1715 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sung Won Sohn </ENAMEX>, chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Norwest Corp . </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis </ENAMEX>, blamed rising energy prices and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">autumn </TIMEX>increase in car prices for most of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>jump . 
1888 ` I would say this is not bad news ; this is a blip , ' he said . 
1949 ` The core rate is not really out of line . ' 
1994 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">All year </TIMEX>, energy prices have skewed the producer price index , which measures changes in the prices <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers </ENAMEX>receive for goods . 
2122 Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last winter </TIMEX>, when a steep run - up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double - digit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>rates . 
2290 Energy prices then plummeted through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer </TIMEX>, causing the index to decline for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three consecutive months </TIMEX>. 
2400 Overall , the index has climbed at a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 . 1 % </NUMEX>compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>rate since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the start of the year </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department </ENAMEX>said . 
2518 While far more restrained than the pace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">at the beginning of the year </TIMEX>, that is still a steeper rise than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 . 0 % </NUMEX>increase for all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>. 
2659 Moreover , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>' s good inflation news may have ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>, when energy prices zoomed up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 . 5 % </NUMEX>after plunging <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 3 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>. 
2793 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the months ahead </TIMEX>, leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain . 
2924 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>had expected that the climb in oil prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 9 % </NUMEX>climb was higher than most anticipated . 
3101 ` I think the resurgence -LCB- in inflation -RCB- is going to continue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few months </TIMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Mueller </ENAMEX>, chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell Mueller Cannon </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>economic forecasting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>. 
3279 He predicted that inflation will moderate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>, saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world - wide . 
3393 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dirk Van Dongen </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Wholesaler - Distributors </ENAMEX>, said that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>' s rise ` is n't as bad an omen ' as the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 9 % </NUMEX>figure suggests . 
3560 ` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad - based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , ' he explained . 
3766 Passenger car prices jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 . 8 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>, after climbing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 5 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>and declining in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the late spring </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer </TIMEX>. 
3888 Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>said the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>increase was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>- time event , coming as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>introduced their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models </ENAMEX>. 
4000 Although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations , car prices rose beyond the customary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">autumn </TIMEX>increase . 
4132 Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 1 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>, while prices for home electronic equipment fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 1 % </NUMEX>. 
4247 Food prices declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 6 % </NUMEX>, after climbing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 3 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>. 
4307 Meanwhile , the retail sales report showed that car sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 8 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 32 . 82 billion </NUMEX>. 
4406 But at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>said . 
4493 Sales at general merchandise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores </ENAMEX>rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 7 % </NUMEX>after declining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 6 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>, while sales of building materials fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 8 % </NUMEX>after rising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 7 % </NUMEX>. 
4636 Producer prices for intermediate goods grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 4 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>, after dropping for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three consecutive months </TIMEX>. 
4744 Prices for crude goods , an array of raw materials , jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 1 % </NUMEX>after declining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 9 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>and edging up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 2 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>. 
4868 Here are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department </ENAMEX>' s producer price indexes -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982 </TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>-RRB- for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>, before seasonal adjustment , and the percentage changes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atco Ltd . </ENAMEX>said its utilities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arm </ENAMEX>is considering building new electric power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>, some valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than one billion Canadian dollars </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US $ 851 million </NUMEX>-RRB- , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Great Britain </ENAMEX>and elsewhere . 
199 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C . S . Richardson </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atco </ENAMEX>' s senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, finance , said its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 . 1 % </NUMEX>- owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Utilities Ltd . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>, and conventional electric power generating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>elsewhere , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private - sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suppliers </ENAMEX>as part of its privatization program . 
598 ` The projects are big . 
621 They can be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C $ 1 billion </NUMEX>plus , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson </ENAMEX>said . 
673 ` But we would n't go into them alone , ' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Utilities </ENAMEX>' equity stake would be small , he said . 
773 ` Ideally , we ' d like to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator </ENAMEX>-LCB- of the project -RCB- and a modest equity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investor </ENAMEX>. 
859 Our long suit is our proven ability to operate ' power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>, he said . 
932 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson </ENAMEX>would n't offer specifics regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atco </ENAMEX>' s proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>project , but he said it would compete for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>huge <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>power generating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>that would be formed under the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>' s plan to privatize its massive water and electric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities </ENAMEX>. 
1210 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>plans to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about # 20 billion </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 31 . 05 billion </NUMEX>-RRB- from the sale of most of its giant water and electric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities </ENAMEX>, beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month </TIMEX>. 
1368 The planned electric utility sale , scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>, is alone expected to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 13 billion </NUMEX>, making it the world ' s largest public offering . 
1517 Under terms of the plan , independent generators would be able to compete for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994 </TIMEX>, and for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">another 10 % </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1994 and 1998 </TIMEX>. 
1668 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Utilities </ENAMEX>had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C $ 1 . 16 billion </NUMEX>, mainly from its natural gas and electric utility <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alberta </ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>serves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 800 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>. 
1847 ` There seems to be a move around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson </ENAMEX>said , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Utilities </ENAMEX>hopes to capitalize on it . 
2007 ` This is a real thrust on our utility side , ' he said , adding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Utilities </ENAMEX>is also mulling projects in underdeveloped <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>, though he would be specific . 
2177 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Utilities </ENAMEX>is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>, in anticipation of the privatization program . 
2310 ` We ' re certainly looking at some power generating projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">England </ENAMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Stram </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, corporate strategy and corporate planning , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Enron Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston </ENAMEX>, a big natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">pipeline </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator </ENAMEX>.

554 He noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan , where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>usually borrows money from <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX>party <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders </ENAMEX>to buy stock that it sets aside to award <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>over time , here <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>had to fork out their own cash for the stock .

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Rosenblatt </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U . S . News &amp; World Report </ENAMEX>, resigned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>from the weekly news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>. 
112 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenblatt </ENAMEX>said he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>' s editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>. 
264 ` Frankly , I missed my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family </ENAMEX>, ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenblatt </ENAMEX>. 
318 In Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenblatt </ENAMEX>' s tenure , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>' s advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly . 
421 But at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 . 3 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly </TIMEX>paid circulation , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U . S . News </ENAMEX>still ranks <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX>behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner Inc . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 . 4 million </NUMEX>circulation , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Washington Post Co . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newsweek </ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 . 3 million </NUMEX>circulation . 
634 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mortimer B . Zuckerman </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor </ENAMEX>in chief , said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenblatt </ENAMEX>would be succeeded starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Ruby </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>' s executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merrill McLoughlin </ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer </ENAMEX>. 
832 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruby </ENAMEX>and Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McLoughlin </ENAMEX>are married to each other . 
887 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zuckerman </ENAMEX>said his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>would maintain its editorial format , which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service - oriented , how - to articles . 
1043 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenblatt </ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>before joining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U . S . News &amp; World Report </ENAMEX>, said he had numerous job offers from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines </ENAMEX>while he was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor </ENAMEX>. 
1207 The offers were to work as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer </ENAMEX>, not an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor </ENAMEX>. 
1259 He said he will now consider those offers .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel Corp . </ENAMEX>reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX>drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>net income , partly because of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>- time charge for discontinued operations . 
137 The big semiconductor and computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>, said it had net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 72 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">38 cents </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 142 . 7 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">78 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
275 The lower net included a charge of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 35 million </NUMEX>, equal to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 cents </NUMEX>a share on an after - tax basis , for the cost of abandoning a computer - systems joint venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Siemens AG </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany </ENAMEX>. 
465 Earning also fell from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - ago </TIMEX>period because of slowing microchip demand . 
545 Sales amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 771 . 4 million </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 7 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 784 . 9 million </NUMEX>. 
612 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel </ENAMEX>' s stock rose in early over - the - counter trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>appeared relieved that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s income from continuing operations was only slightly below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter </TIMEX>' s earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 99 . 3 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">53 cents </NUMEX>a share , and that sales actually exceeded the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 747 . 3 million </NUMEX>for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>period . 
925 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel </ENAMEX>later succumbed to the stock market ' s plunge , closing at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 31 . 75 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 125 </NUMEX>. 
1015 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel </ENAMEX>warned that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>earnings might be ` flat to down ' from the previous period ' s because of slowing sales growth of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">80386 </ENAMEX>microprocessor , start - up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">80486 </ENAMEX>chip in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the current quarter </TIMEX>. 
1330 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew S . Grove </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>, said ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel </ENAMEX>' s business is strong . 
1436 Our bookings improved as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>progressed and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>was especially good . 
1519 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the full quarter </TIMEX>, our bookings were higher than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous quarter </TIMEX>, and our book - to - bill ratio exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 . 0 </NUMEX>. ' 
1637 For the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">nine - month </TIMEX>period , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel </ENAMEX>reported net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 268 . 3 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 43 </NUMEX>a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 367 . 1 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 05 </NUMEX>a share . 
1768 Revenue amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 23 billion </NUMEX>, up slightly from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 15 billion </NUMEX>.  

9 Assuming the stock market does n't crash again and completely discredit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies </ENAMEX>and trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rooms </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>television <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few months </TIMEX>may be seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>' s concept of both . 
194 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Capital City </ENAMEX>' is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly </TIMEX>series that premiered here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three weeks ago </TIMEX>amid unprecedented hype by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thames Television </ENAMEX>. 
326 The early episodes make you long for a rerun of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">the crash of 1987 </ENAMEX>. 
393 Let ' s make that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1929 </TIMEX>, just to be sure . 
434 According to the program ' s publicity prospectus , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Capital City </ENAMEX>, ' set at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shane Longman </ENAMEX>, a fictional mid - sized securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 500 million </NUMEX>capital , ` follows the fortunes of a close - knit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team </ENAMEX>of young , high - flying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>, hired for their particular blend of style , genius and energy . 
722 But with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well ; pressure to pull off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another million </NUMEX>before lunch ; pressure to anticipate the market by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a fraction of a second </TIMEX>. . . ' 
935 You need n't be a high - powered securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer </ENAMEX>to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure . 
1049 The slickly produced series has been criticized by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>' s financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cognoscenti </ENAMEX>as inaccurate in detail , but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters </ENAMEX>' professional and private lives . 
1261 Turned loose in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shane Longman </ENAMEX>' s trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">room </ENAMEX>, the yuppie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers </ENAMEX>do little right . 
1343 Judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shane Longman </ENAMEX>' s capital should be just about exhausted by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the final 13th week </TIMEX>. 
1491 In the opening episode we learn that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle </ENAMEX>, a junior bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader </ENAMEX>, has indeed pulled off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another million </NUMEX>before lunch . 
1612 Trouble is , she has lost it just as quickly . 
1657 Rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle </ENAMEX>blabs about it to a sandwich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>while ordering lunch over the phone . 
1797 Little chance that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shane Longman </ENAMEX>is going to recoup <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. 
1856 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>spend the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning </TIMEX>frantically selling bonds , in the belief that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly </TIMEX>trade figures will look lousy . 
1976 Ah , perfidious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Columbia </ENAMEX>! 
2001 The trade figures turn out well , and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price . 
2088 So much for anticipating the market by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a fraction of a second </TIMEX>. 
2151 And a large slice of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly worthless <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>bonds -LRB- since when is anything <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>nearly worthless nowadays ? -RRB- . 
2325 Surprisingly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shane Longman </ENAMEX>survives <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week </TIMEX>, only to have a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>innocently bumble his way into becoming the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target </ENAMEX>of a criminal insider trading investigation . 
2500 Instead of closing ranks to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>' s reputation , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>' s internal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals </ENAMEX>, led by a loutish <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>, demand his resignation . 
2643 The plot is thwarted when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>' s major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholder </ENAMEX>, kelp farming on the other side of the globe , hurries <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">home </ENAMEX>to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive </ENAMEX>. 
2783 But the investigation continues . 
2818 If you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six </NUMEX>- figure salaries , you still are left puzzled , because few of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies </ENAMEX>consume very conspicuously . 
2994 In fact , few consume much of anything . 
3033 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two </NUMEX>share a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house </ENAMEX>almost devoid of furniture . 
3079 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle </ENAMEX>lives in a hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room </ENAMEX>, and although she drives a canary - colored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Porsche </ENAMEX>, she has n't time to clean or repair it ; the beat - up <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle </ENAMEX>can be started only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock . 
3320 And it takes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Declan </ENAMEX>, the obligatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast </ENAMEX>, until the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX>episode to get past <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>base with any of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prey </ENAMEX>. 
3452 Perhaps the explanation for these anomalies is that class - conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>is n't ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the Thatcherian free - enterprise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime </ENAMEX>. 
3624 After all , this is n't old money , but new money , and in many cases , young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">money </ENAMEX>. 
3706 This attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max </ENAMEX>, the trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">room </ENAMEX>' s most flamboyant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character </ENAMEX>. 
3814 Yuppily enough , he lives in a lavishly furnished converted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church </ENAMEX>, wears designer clothes and drives an antique <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car </ENAMEX>. 
3931 But apparently to make him palatable , even lovable , to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses </ENAMEX>, the script inflates pony - tailed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max </ENAMEX>into an eccentric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master </ENAMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese </ENAMEX>dialects . 
4091 He takes his wash to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">laundromat </ENAMEX>, where he meets a punky <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl </ENAMEX>who dupes him into providing a home for her pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">piranha </ENAMEX>and then promptly steals his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car </ENAMEX>and dumps it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dieppe </ENAMEX>. 
4278 In producing and promoting ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Capital City </ENAMEX>, ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thames </ENAMEX>has spent about as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shane Longman </ENAMEX>loses on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a good day </TIMEX>. 
4390 The production costs are a not inconsiderable <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 8 million </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 . 4 million </NUMEX>-RRB- , and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">set </ENAMEX>been absorbed in the budget of ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Dealers </ENAMEX>, ' an earlier made - for - TV movie . 
4610 Another <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">half million quid </NUMEX>went for a volley of full - page advertisements in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six </NUMEX>major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>and for huge posters in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">subway </ENAMEX>. 
4759 These expenses create a special incentive for ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Capital City ' s </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers </ENAMEX>to flog it , or a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Yank </ENAMEX>- oriented version of it , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America </ENAMEX>. 
4890 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thames </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Taffner </ENAMEX>, is preparing to do just that . 
4967 He is discreetly hopeful , citing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>comedy series - - ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Three ' s Company </ENAMEX>, ' ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Too Close for Comfort </ENAMEX>' and ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Check It Out </ENAMEX>' - - that had <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>antecedents . 
5125 Perhaps without realizing it , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taffner </ENAMEX>simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution : ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Capital City </ENAMEX>' should have been a comedy , a worthy sequel to the screwball <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Carry On </ENAMEX>' movies of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s </TIMEX>. 
5356 The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">seeds </ENAMEX>already are in the script . 
5393 The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the trading - room <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew </ENAMEX>minded a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">casualty </ENAMEX>of a broken marriage at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>. 
5544 And many in the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast </ENAMEX>bear striking resemblances to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>TV and movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities </ENAMEX>known for light roles . 
5660 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joanna Kanska </ENAMEX>looks like a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zsa Zsa Gabor </ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Armstrong </ENAMEX>, who plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max </ENAMEX>, could pass for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Conreid </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Hodge </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Declan </ENAMEX>-RRB- for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Farentino </ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rolf Saxon </ENAMEX>is a passable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Noonan </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorian Healy </ENAMEX>could easily double for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huntz Hall </ENAMEX>, the blank - faced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foil </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Bowery Boys </ENAMEX>comedies . 
5962 So , OK <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids </ENAMEX>, everybody on stage for ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Carry On Trading </ENAMEX>' : The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast </ENAMEX>is frantically searching the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">office </ENAMEX>for misplaced <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese </ENAMEX>bonds that suddenly have soared in value because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank </ENAMEX>has just bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House </ENAMEX>. 
6189 The pressure is too much for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zsa Zsa </ENAMEX>, who slaps a security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard </ENAMEX>. 
6255 He backflips into a desktop computer terminal , which explodes , covering <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huntz Hall </ENAMEX>' s face with microchips . 
6362 And all the while , the bonds are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby </ENAMEX>' s diaper . 
6419 It should run forever . 
6444 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rustin </ENAMEX>is senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bureau </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ideal Basic Industries Inc . </ENAMEX>said its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors </ENAMEX>reached an agreement in principle calling for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HOFI North America Inc . </ENAMEX>to combine its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American </ENAMEX>cement holdings with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ideal </ENAMEX>in a transaction that will leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ideal </ENAMEX>' s minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 . 8 % </NUMEX>of the combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
284 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HOFI </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American </ENAMEX>holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss </ENAMEX>concern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Holderbank Financiere Glaris Ltd . </ENAMEX>, previously proposed combining its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 % </NUMEX>stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">St . Lawrence Cement Inc . </ENAMEX>and its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 % </NUMEX>stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dundee Cement Co . </ENAMEX>with its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67 % </NUMEX>stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ideal </ENAMEX>. 
520 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HOFI </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>offer would have given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ideal </ENAMEX>' s other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 % </NUMEX>of the combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
622 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ideal </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors </ENAMEX>rejected that offer , although they said they endorsed the merger proposal . 
717 Under the agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HOFI </ENAMEX>will own <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87 . 2 % </NUMEX>of the combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
783 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ideal </ENAMEX>' s current operations will represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 39 . 2 % </NUMEX>of the combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
864 The transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ideal </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>. 
953 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ideal </ENAMEX>said it expects to complete the transaction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year </TIMEX>.  

9 It was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the 13th </TIMEX>, and the stock market plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 200 </NUMEX>points . 
83 Just a coincidence ? 
103 Or is <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">triskaidekaphobia </ENAMEX>- - fear of the number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 </NUMEX>- - justified ? 
168 In academia , a so - called <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the 13th </TIMEX>effect has been set up and shot down by different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors </ENAMEX>. 
273 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Kolb </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricardo Rodriguez </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors </ENAMEX>of finance at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Miami </ENAMEX>, found evidence that the market is spooked by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the 13th </TIMEX>. 
420 But their study , which spanned the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1962 - 85 </TIMEX>period , has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data . 
537 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the ' 70s </TIMEX>, the market took falls <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine </NUMEX>times in a row on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the you - know - what </TIMEX>. 
621 But the date tends to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yale Hirsch </ENAMEX>, a collector of stock market lore . 
741 Another study found that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Fridays the 13th </TIMEX>in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1940 - 1987 </TIMEX>period had higher than average returns - - higher even than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Fridays </TIMEX>in general , which tend to be strong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days </TIMEX>for stock prices . 
935 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the only other Friday the 13th this year </TIMEX>, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four </NUMEX>points . 
1039 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kolb </ENAMEX>says the original study , titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Friday the 13th , Part VII </ENAMEX>, was published tongue - in - cheek . 
1144 In a similar vein , he adds that the anniversary of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday </TIMEX>' s full moon could have played a part , too , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s market activity .  

9 The only thing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Goldberg </ENAMEX>could praise about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS </ENAMEX>' s new show ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Island Son </ENAMEX>' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Leisure &amp; Arts </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 25 </TIMEX>-RRB- was the local color ; unfortunately neither he nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">producers </ENAMEX>of the show have done their homework . 
216 For instance : ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Haole </ENAMEX>' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">white </ENAMEX>-RRB- is not the ultimate insult ; ` Mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haole </ENAMEX>' is . 
295 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Chamberlain </ENAMEX>dresses as a ` Mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haole </ENAMEX>, ' tucking in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hawaiian </ENAMEX>shirt and rolling up its long sleeves . 
407 And the local expression for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother </ENAMEX>is ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brah </ENAMEX>, ' not ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bruddah </ENAMEX>. ' 
470 And even if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse </ENAMEX>would wear <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers </ENAMEX>in her hair while on duty , if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left , not right , ear . 
617 Sorry , the show does not even have the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>redeeming quality of genuine local color .

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Institut Merieux S . A . </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught BioSciences Inc . </ENAMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">942 million Canadian dollars </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US $ 801 . 6 million </NUMEX>-RRB- . 
202 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merieux </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister </ENAMEX>of industry , science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of ` net benefit ' to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>. 
372 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX>investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard . 
455 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>gave it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 days </TIMEX>in which to submit information to further support its takeover plan . 
581 Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merieux </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught </ENAMEX>are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns </ENAMEX>. 
673 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>' s action was unusual . 
710 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Nymark </ENAMEX>, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Investment Canada </ENAMEX>, which oversees foreign takeovers , said it marked the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>time in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four - year </TIMEX>history that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency </ENAMEX>has made an adverse net - benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
968 He said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns </ENAMEX>, but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed . 
1118 ` This is n't a change in government policy ; this provision has been used before , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jodi Redmond </ENAMEX>, press <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvie Andre </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister </ENAMEX>of industry , science and technology . 
1307 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andre </ENAMEX>issued the ruling based on a recommendation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Investment Canada </ENAMEX>. 
1385 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Spokesmen </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merieux </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught </ENAMEX>said they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Investment Canada </ENAMEX>, but added they hope to have more information <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early this week </TIMEX>. 
1592 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Investment Canada </ENAMEX>declined to comment on the reasons for the government decision . 
1676 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viren Mehta </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mehta &amp; Isaly </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>- based pharmaceutical industry research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>' s ruling was n't unexpected . 
1825 ` This has become a very politicized deal , concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>' s only large , world - class bio - research or pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta </ENAMEX>said . 
1970 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta </ENAMEX>said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an out - of - court settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught </ENAMEX>' s dispute with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Toronto </ENAMEX>. 
2141 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University </ENAMEX>is seeking to block the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught </ENAMEX>by foreign interests , citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>. 
2304 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">university </ENAMEX>is considering a settlement proposal made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught </ENAMEX>. 
2375 While neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">side </ENAMEX>will disclose its contents , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta </ENAMEX>expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merieux </ENAMEX>offered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Investment Canada </ENAMEX>. 
2578 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Grossner </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toronto </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Richardson Greenshields Inc . </ENAMEX>, believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>ruling leaves the door open for other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bidders </ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Switzerland </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ciba - Geigy </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chiron Corp . </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Emeryville </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .  
2806 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials </ENAMEX>for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns </ENAMEX>, which are bidding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C $ 30 </NUMEX>a share for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught </ENAMEX>, could n't be reached for comment . 
2919 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French </ENAMEX>state - owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rhone - Poulenc S . A . </ENAMEX>holds <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merieux </ENAMEX>.  

9 The debate over National Service has begun again . 
59 After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a decade </TIMEX>in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">localities </ENAMEX>established their own service or conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corps </ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens </NUMEX>of school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">systems </ENAMEX>made community service a prerequisite to high - school graduation , the focus has shifted to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>. 
292 At least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 </NUMEX>bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this spring </TIMEX>. 
393 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>, co - sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Nunn </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ga . </ENAMEX>-RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave McCurdy </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Okla . </ENAMEX>-RRB- , would have restricted federal college subsidies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students </ENAMEX>who had served . 
549 An omnibus bill assembled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kennedy </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass . </ENAMEX>-RRB- , and including some diluted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nunn </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurdy </ENAMEX>provisions along with proposals by fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sens . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claiborne Pell </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Mikulski </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Dodd </ENAMEX>, has been reported out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Labor Committee </ENAMEX>. 
818 It might well win <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>passage . 
852 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>has outlined his own Youth Entering Service -LRB- YES -RRB- plan , though its details remain to be specified . 
968 What is one to think of all this ? 
1002 Doctrine and special interests govern some responses . 
1056 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>eager to have youth ` pay their dues to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">society </ENAMEX>' favor service proposals - - preferably mandatory ones . 
1165 So do those who seek a ` re - energized concept of citizenship , ' a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights . 
1294 Then there are instinctive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents </ENAMEX>. 
1332 To <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarians </ENAMEX>, mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money . 
1443 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Devotees </ENAMEX>of the market question the value of the work national service would perform : 
1529 If the market wo n't pay for it , they argue , it ca n't be worth its cost . 
1601 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elements </ENAMEX>of the left are also reflexively opposed ; they see service as a cover for the draft , or fear the regimentation of youth , or want to see rights enlarged , not obligations . 
1782 But what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology ? 
1867 How should we think about national service ? 
1911 Let ' s begin by recognizing a main source of confusion - - ` national service ' has no agreed meaning . 
2010 Would service be voluntary or compulsory ? 
2052 Short or long ? 
2067 Part - time or full - time ? 
2091 Paid or unpaid ? 
2107 Would <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants </ENAMEX>live at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home </ENAMEX>and work nearby or live in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">barracks </ENAMEX>and work on public lands ? 
2201 What kinds of work would they do ? 
2237 What does ` national ' mean ? 
2264 Would the program be run by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>, by local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments </ENAMEX>, or by private voluntary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations </ENAMEX>? 
2377 And who would serve ? 
2398 Only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males </ENAMEX>, as with the draft , or both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes </ENAMEX>? 
2444 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Youth </ENAMEX>only or all ages ? 
2468 Middle - class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>, or poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>, or a genuine cross - section ? 
2533 Many or few ? 
2548 Those are not trivial questions , and the label ` national service ' answers none of them . 
2636 Then how should we think about national service ? 
2685 As a starting point , here are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>propositions : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 </NUMEX>. Consider the ingredients , not the name . 
2779 Ignore ` national service ' in the abstract ; consider specific proposals . 
2851 They will differ in crucial ways . 
2887 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 </NUMEX>. ` Service ' should be service . 
2919 As commonly understood , service implies sacrifice . 
2970 It involves accepting risk , or giving up income , or deferring a career . 
3042 It follows that proposals like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nunn </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurdy </ENAMEX>, whose benefits to enrollees are worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 17 , 500 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year </TIMEX>, do not qualify . 
3162 There is a rationale for such bills : Federal subsidies to college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students </ENAMEX>amount to ` a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI Bill </ENAMEX>without the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI </ENAMEX>' ; arguably those benefits should be earned , not given . 
3328 But the earnings exceed by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 % </NUMEX>the average income of young high - school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates </ENAMEX>with full - time jobs . 
3430 Why call that service ? 
3455 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 </NUMEX>. Encouragement is fine ; compulsion is not . 
3500 Compelled service is unconstitutional . 
3539 It is also unwise and unenforceable . 
3576 -LRB- Who will throw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred thousand </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refusers </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">jail </ENAMEX>each year ? -RRB- 
3646 But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior . 
3745 It should also encourage service - - preferably by all classes and all ages . 
3821 Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>, should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing . 
4055 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 </NUMEX>. Good programs are not cheap . 
4087 Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply : forest fires fought , housing rehabilitated , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students </ENAMEX>tutored , day - care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">centers </ENAMEX>staffed . 
4255 There is important work to be done , and existing service and conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corps </ENAMEX>have shown that even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youths </ENAMEX>who start with few skills can do much of it well - - but not cheaply . 
4434 Good service programs require recruitment , screening , training and supervision - - all of high quality . 
4537 They involve stipends to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants </ENAMEX>. 
4576 Full - time residential programs also require housing and full - time supervision ; they are particularly expensive - - more per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant </ENAMEX>than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year </TIMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Stanford </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Yale </ENAMEX>. 
4744 Non - residential programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 10 , 000 </NUMEX>a year . 
4831 Are they worth that ? 
4852 Evaluations suggest that good ones are - - especially so if the effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants </ENAMEX>are counted . 
4952 But the calculations are challengeable . 
4994 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 </NUMEX>. Underclass <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth </ENAMEX>are a special concern . 
5037 Are such expenditures worthwhile , then ? 
5077 Yes , if targeted . 
5095 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for middle - class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids </ENAMEX>, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elders </ENAMEX>, to serve at little public cost . 
5258 They can volunteer at any of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands </NUMEX>of non - profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions </ENAMEX>, or participate in service programs required by high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools </ENAMEX>or encouraged by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">colleges </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers </ENAMEX>. 
5427 Underclass <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth </ENAMEX>do n't have those opportunities . 
5476 They are not enrolled in high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">college </ENAMEX>. 
5525 They are unlikely to be employed . 
5559 And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances , among family structures breaking down , surrounded by self - destructive behaviors and bleak prospects . 
5722 But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service . 
5815 Some wo n't accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons . 
5884 But some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed . 
5940 Learning skills , producing something cooperatively , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent - - others now depend on them . 
6067 Even if it is cheaper to build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">playgrounds </ENAMEX>or paint <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartments </ENAMEX>or plant dune - <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass </ENAMEX>with paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals </ENAMEX>, the effects on the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>providing those services alter the calculation . 
6257 Strictly speaking , these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth </ENAMEX>are not performing service . 
6316 They are giving up no income , deferring no careers , incurring no risk . 
6387 But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin to respect themselves -LRB- and others -RRB- , to take control of their lives , to think of the future . 
6537 That is a service to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>. 
6570 It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve . 
6630 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Szanton </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter </ENAMEX>administration budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>, heads his own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>- based strategic planning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>. 
6740 He is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co - author </ENAMEX>of ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">National Service : What Would It Mean </ENAMEX>? ' 
6801 -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexington Books </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>-RRB- .  

9 The carnage among takeover stocks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>does n't mean the end of mega - mergers but simply marks the start of a less ambitious game , Wall Street ' s big - time deal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers </ENAMEX>say . 
182 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Suitors </ENAMEX>from now on are more likely to be expansion - minded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>, rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raiders </ENAMEX>or debt - happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financiers </ENAMEX>. 
298 And they will be launching lower - priced and perhaps fewer deals , now that it ' s tougher to finance them . 
404 This is an ominous sign for a stock market that lately has been fueled by takeover speculation and bidding wars for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>that put themselves up for sale . 
563 Whenever <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s </TIMEX>merger boom seems to be stalling , shock waves ripple through the stock market . 
663 ` The market is overvalued , not cheap , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Gaines </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>money - management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gaines Berland </ENAMEX>. 
773 He recently began increasing his cash position to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 % </NUMEX>of his portfolio . 
845 ` I look at where deals can get done , ' he says , ` and they ' re not getting done ' at current prices . 
944 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Lenders </ENAMEX>are growing increasingly nervous about debt - financed takeovers , investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>say . 
1040 ` You had a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">week </TIMEX>of a deteriorating junk - bond market that ran smack into the news on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>about what appeared to be happening to the bank debt market , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Rattner </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>and merger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lazard Freres &amp; Co .  
1273 Trading dried up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>in the market for high - yield junk bonds , often used to finance takeovers . 
1371 It was the latest in a series of setbacks for the junk bond market , where prices began weakening <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau </ENAMEX>hit a cash crunch . 
1514 And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>appear to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests for high - risk takeover loans . 
1617 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>trying to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>that it could n't arrange the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 . 2 billion </NUMEX>in bank loans it needs to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines </ENAMEX>for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 </NUMEX>a share . 
1784 Takeover - stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>today will be scrambling to learn of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>developments , and other takeover stocks are likely to trade in sympathy . 
1925 Investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>representing the buy - out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board </ENAMEX>spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a frantic weekend </TIMEX>trying to hammer out new terms that would be more acceptable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>. 
2092 After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>, the stock viewed as most vulnerable is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>, the target of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 120 </NUMEX>- a - share takeover proposal from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump </ENAMEX>. 
2270 Trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>shares was suspended shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 p . m . EDT </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>and did n't resume . 
2357 Before the halt , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>last traded at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 5 \/ 8 </NUMEX>. 
2401 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Late Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferies &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles </ENAMEX>securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>, traded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR </ENAMEX>shares at prices as low as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 </NUMEX>. 
2531 Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta Air Lines </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir Group </ENAMEX>dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 . 1 % and 8 . 5 % </NUMEX>, respectively , on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>and could weaken further . 
2650 Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weeked </TIMEX>, however , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>developments in other deals indicated that commerical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>and Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>still are willing to commit <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars </NUMEX>to finance takeover bids launched by major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>. 
2866 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vitro S . A . </ENAMEX>, a major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican </ENAMEX>glass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>that it agreed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anchor Glass Container </ENAMEX>in a tender offer for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21 . 25 </NUMEX>a share , sweetened from the original <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 </NUMEX>- a - share offer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vitro </ENAMEX>launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two months ago </TIMEX>. 
3082 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anchor </ENAMEX>shares fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1 \/ 4 </NUMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>. 
3140 For the broader market , the greatest significance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vitro - Anchor </ENAMEX>deal may be that it was put together <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night </TIMEX>- - after the market rout - - and involves a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 155 million </NUMEX>temporary ` bridge ' loan from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities </ENAMEX>and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 139 million </NUMEX>loan from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific National Bank </ENAMEX>. 
3453 Moreover , to complete the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anchor Glass </ENAMEX>purchase and refinance existing debt , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson </ENAMEX>said it is ` highly confident ' that it will be able to sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million </NUMEX>of junk bonds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vitro </ENAMEX>, despite the current disarray in the junk bond market . 
3698 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson </ENAMEX>' s statement is n't merely an idle boast , because those bonds will have to be sold before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson </ENAMEX>' s bridge loan can be paid back . 
3838 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific </ENAMEX>, meanwhile , said it expects to arrange <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 430 million </NUMEX>in bank loans for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vitro </ENAMEX>. 
3934 In another takeover battle , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw Cellular Communications </ENAMEX>said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw </ENAMEX>has been advised by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>that they remain ` highly confident ' they can arrange <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 5 billion </NUMEX>of bank loans for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw </ENAMEX>' s tender offer for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 45 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN Broadcasting </ENAMEX>, ` notwithstanding recent events . ' 
4252 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw </ENAMEX>is offering <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 125 </NUMEX>a share for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 million </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN </ENAMEX>shares , thereby challenging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN </ENAMEX>' s proposal to spin off its television properties , pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 </NUMEX>- a - share special dividend and combine its cellular - telephone operations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth </ENAMEX>' s cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business </ENAMEX>. 
4516 On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN </ENAMEX>shares were among the few takeover issues that did n't fall much , dropping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 . 9 % </NUMEX>, to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>. 
4642 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders </ENAMEX>and investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN </ENAMEX>shares were n't hurt much because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth </ENAMEX>is viewed as a well - financed corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer </ENAMEX>unlikely to be affected by skittishness among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>or bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>. 
4842 Investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>interviewed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>see a silver lining for the merger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business </ENAMEX>in the stock - market drop . 
4960 Potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bidders </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>` were saying that things were beginning to look expensive , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rattner </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lazard </ENAMEX>. 
5082 ` Nothing makes things look cheaper than a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 </NUMEX>- point drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow </ENAMEX>, ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rattner </ENAMEX>says . 
5170 ` Just as there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>waiting to become bargain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters </ENAMEX>in the stock market , there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>waiting to become bargain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters </ENAMEX>in the deal market . ' 
5325 Investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>expect most of those bargain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters </ENAMEX>to be well - heeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>. 
5415 ` In the past , corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>were often discouraged from making bids because of competition from LBO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>, which were often prepared to outbid ' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J . Tomilson Hill </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head </ENAMEX>of mergers and acquisitions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton </ENAMEX>. 
5663 Now , ` corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers </ENAMEX>should be willing to re - enter the acquisition market because the competition from junkbond - financed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyers </ENAMEX>has been reduced . ' 
5814 Many takeover stocks plunged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators </ENAMEX>retained their confidence in corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers </ENAMEX>but fled from the socalled whisper stocks , the targets of rumored deals . 
5987 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment </ENAMEX>, which has agreed to a friendly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27 </NUMEX>- a - share bid from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>, fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1 \/ 8 </NUMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 5 \/ 8 </NUMEX>. 
6123 But several stocks long rumored to be ripe for a takeover or restructuring fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>or more . 
6216 They include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USX </ENAMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 . 7 % </NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Upjohn </ENAMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 . 1 % </NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell Soup </ENAMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 % </NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paramount Communications </ENAMEX>, off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 . 3 % </NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Woolworth </ENAMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 . 2 % </NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta Air Lines </ENAMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 . 1 % </NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA </ENAMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 . 7 % </NUMEX>. 
6402 The market - - and investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>- - are even less sanguine about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>that have had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one </NUMEX>bid , merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already . 
6574 Given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>fear that these transactions may be revised yet again . 
6709 Examples include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kollmorgen </ENAMEX>, whose agreement to be acquired for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 </NUMEX>a share by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vernitron </ENAMEX>collapsed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>. 
6820 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kollmorgen </ENAMEX>shares fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 20 % </NUMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 7 \/ 8 </NUMEX>. 
6886 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada </ENAMEX>, which first delayed and then shelved a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million </NUMEX>junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring , fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 . 6 % </NUMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>. 
7042 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada </ENAMEX>has said it hopes to propose a new restructuring plan but has n't indicated when it will do so . 
7146 Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Medical International </ENAMEX>, which agreed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>to accept a lower price from a buy - out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp . </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pritzker </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>, fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 . 8 % </NUMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 </NUMEX>. 
7362 The buy - out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>is offering <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26 . 50 </NUMEX>a share for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 million </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Medical </ENAMEX>shares , down from its offer in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28 </NUMEX>a share for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68 . 8 million </NUMEX>shares . 
7517 But investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>say the market may have oversold some takeover - related stocks . 
7603 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Hilton Hotels </ENAMEX>, for example , was among the worst - hit issues , falling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 . 2 % </NUMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
7718 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton </ENAMEX>currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">businesses </ENAMEX>. 
7816 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton </ENAMEX>said over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>that the depth of the sell - off in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton </ENAMEX>shares was unwarranted because none of the likely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyers </ENAMEX>would be dependent on junk - bond financing . 
8007 However , they conceded that some potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bidders </ENAMEX>would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>buy - out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>signified a general unwillingness among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>to provide credit for debt - financed takeovers . 
8237 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>said they were n't worried about the drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s stock . 
8319 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lebo </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton </ENAMEX>' s general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel </ENAMEX>, said plans to consider a sale of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>or some of its assets are ` on track ' for what has been described previously as ` a slow and deliberate process . ' 
8518 ` I ca n't believe that any potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyer </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton </ENAMEX>would be affected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one day </TIMEX>' s trading , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lebo </ENAMEX>said . 
8629 But the stock market as a whole , bolstered as it is by takeover speculation , remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financiers </ENAMEX>, both in the junkbond market and among commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>. 
8829 For debt - ridden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">suitors </ENAMEX>, ` the takeover game has been over for some time , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Weisman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chilmark Capital </ENAMEX>, who has been keeping <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 % </NUMEX>of his portfolio in cash .

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed Corp . </ENAMEX>, said it agreed to join with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aermacchi S . p . A . </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Varese </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy </ENAMEX>, to propose a new generation of jet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trainers </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U .

204 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force </ENAMEX>is looking to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">540 </NUMEX>new primary jet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trainers </ENAMEX>, with a total value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 5 billion to $ 2 billion </NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1994 and 2004 </TIMEX>. 
339 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft </ENAMEX>would replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">T - 37 </ENAMEX>, made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cessna Aircraft Co . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Dynamics Corp . </ENAMEX>, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force </ENAMEX>uses to train <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">jet </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots </ENAMEX>. 
486 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy </ENAMEX>may also buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 340 </NUMEX>trainer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft </ENAMEX>to replace its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">T34C </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trainers </ENAMEX>made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beech Aircraft Corp . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Raytheon Corp .  
649 Under the agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aermacchi </ENAMEX>will license <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed </ENAMEX>to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aermacchi </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">MB - 339 </ENAMEX>jet tandem - <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trainer </ENAMEX>and will supply certain structures .

965 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Burbank </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, said he was n't aware of which other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>would be competing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force </ENAMEX>contract .  

9 When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Brennan </ENAMEX>marks the start of his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">34th </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year </TIMEX>on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>, the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure . 
177 For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>time , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">83 - year - old </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice </ENAMEX>finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent , rather than as a force in the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority </ENAMEX>. 
325 This role reversal holds true , as well , for his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>liberal and moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justices </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurgood Marshall </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Blackmun </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Stevens </ENAMEX>. 
471 But are these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>of them in their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">80s </TIMEX>, ready to assume a different role after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">88 years </TIMEX>, collectively , of service on the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>? 
622 Every indication is that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>are prepared to accept this new role , and the frustrations that go with it , but in different ways . 
755 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justices </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brennan </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens </ENAMEX>appear philosophical about it ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justices </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blackmun </ENAMEX>appear fighting mad . 
869 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices </ENAMEX>are no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers </ENAMEX>to dissent , often joining forces in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past decade </TIMEX>to criticize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>' s conservative drift . 
1001 But always , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years past </TIMEX>, they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth </NUMEX>vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases . 
1174 Now , however , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>' s new <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>- member conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority </ENAMEX>continues to solidify , victories for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals </ENAMEX>are rare . 
1303 The change is most dramatic for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brennan </ENAMEX>, the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor </ENAMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid - 1960s </TIMEX>liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority </ENAMEX>under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earl Warren </ENAMEX>. 
1437 In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court </ENAMEX>terms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967 </TIMEX>, the height of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Court </ENAMEX>' s power , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brennan </ENAMEX>cast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 25 </NUMEX>dissenting votes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">555 </NUMEX>cases decided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>. 
1641 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last term </TIMEX>alone he cast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 </NUMEX>dissenting votes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133 </NUMEX>decisions , with the contentious flag - burning ruling as his only big victory . 
1771 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brennan </ENAMEX>foresaw his new role , strongly defending the importance of dissents in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985 </TIMEX>speech . 
1877 ` Each time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>revisits an issue , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices </ENAMEX>will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result , ' he said . 
2035 Moreover , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months </TIMEX>he has said that when he was on the winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">side </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s </TIMEX>, he knew that the tables might turn in the future . 
2175 He has said that he now knows how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Harlan </ENAMEX>felt , a reference to the late conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice </ENAMEX>who was the most frequent dissenter from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Court </ENAMEX>' s opinions . 
2352 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Associates </ENAMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">81 - year - old </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall </ENAMEX>say he was ` depressed ' about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>' s direction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring </TIMEX>, but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>' s cutbacks in civil rights . 
2562 ` We could sweep it under the rug and hide it , but I ' m not going to do it , ' he said in a speech <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>. 
2671 He , like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brennan </ENAMEX>, considers dissents highly important for the future , a point that has n't escaped legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars </ENAMEX>. 
2793 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard Law School </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Tribe </ENAMEX>says there is a ` generation - skipping ' flavor to current dissents . 
2903 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissenters </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Court </ENAMEX>, he says , appeared to be writing for the short - term , suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>' s direction might change soon . 
3048 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brennan </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall </ENAMEX>are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future , ' he says . 
3139 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blackmun </ENAMEX>, who will turn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">81 </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month </TIMEX>, also seems feisty about his new role . 
3224 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Associates </ENAMEX>say he takes some defeats more personally than his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues </ENAMEX>, especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>recognized in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973 </TIMEX>opinion , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe </ENAMEX>vs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade </ENAMEX>. 
3405 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Friends </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates </ENAMEX>who saw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blackmun </ENAMEX>during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer </TIMEX>said he was no more discouraged about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years </TIMEX>. 
3541 And his outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>. 
3613 But his level of frustration showed in a recent , impassioned speech to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group </ENAMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>. 
3727 He concluded his remarks by quoting , emotionally and at some length , according to those present , the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther King </ENAMEX>' s famous ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">I Have a Dream </ENAMEX>' speech from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1963 </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">March on Washington </ENAMEX>. 
3922 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">69 </TIMEX>, is probably the most philosophical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissenters </ENAMEX>about his role , in part because he may be the least <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal </ENAMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>, but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority </ENAMEX>more than the others . 
4176 If the role these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissenters </ENAMEX>are assuming is a familiar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court </ENAMEX>history , it also differs in an important way from recent history , court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers </ENAMEX>say . 
4351 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissenters </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Court </ENAMEX>were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A . E . Dick Howard </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Virginia Law School </ENAMEX>, ` but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissenters </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>are defending a legacy that they created .  

9 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>, which is finalizing its steel - import quotas , is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries . 
217 Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>has negotiated a significant cut in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>' s steel quota , and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community </ENAMEX>. 
378 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil </ENAMEX>, similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea </ENAMEX>, is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>market than it had under the previous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five - year </TIMEX>steel quotas , which expired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 30 </TIMEX>. 
568 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Venezuela </ENAMEX>are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>that have n't completed steel talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ending Oct . 1 , 1990 </TIMEX>. 
701 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers </ENAMEX>have supplied <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 % </NUMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">100 million tons </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually </TIMEX>by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>. 
821 Of the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 % </NUMEX>needed , the steel - quota negotiations allocate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 % </NUMEX>to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">suppliers </ENAMEX>, with the difference supplied mainly by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>- - which is n't included in the quota program . 
1012 Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>that do n't have formal steel quotas with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Taiwan </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Sweden </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Argentina </ENAMEX>, also have supplied <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>. 
1143 Some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>have in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years </TIMEX>made informal agreements with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>that are similar to quotas . 
1257 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year </TIMEX>said it would extend steel quotas , known as voluntary restraint agreements , until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 31 , 1992 </TIMEX>. 
1397 It also said it would use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">that two - and - a - half year </TIMEX>period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade , which has been notoriously managed , subsidized and protected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments </ENAMEX>. 
1619 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>termed its plan , a ` trade liberalization program , ' despite the fact that it is merely an extension . 
1730 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico </ENAMEX>, which was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries </ENAMEX>to conclude its steel talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>, virtually doubled its quota to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 95 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>steel market from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 48 % </NUMEX>under the previous quotas . 
1918 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea </ENAMEX>, which had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 9 % </NUMEX>under the previous quotas , is set to get a small increase to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1 . 95 % </NUMEX>. 
2020 That increase rises to slightly more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>market if a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Korean </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>steel project is included . 
2134 Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil </ENAMEX>is expected to increase its allowance from the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 . 43 % </NUMEX>share it has had in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years </TIMEX>. 
2241 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>- - the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>' s largest steel <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">suppliers </ENAMEX>- - have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent . 
2353 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC </ENAMEX>steel industry , which has been coping with strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX>demand , has been supplying <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>market compared with recent quotas of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 6 . 7 % </NUMEX>. 
2517 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>has been shipping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>to total <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 4 . 5 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>market compared with a quota of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 . 9 % </NUMEX>. 
2619 In the recent talks , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC </ENAMEX>had its quota increased <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">about 300 , 000 tons </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>market from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 . 7 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>. 
2735 But its quota has been as high as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 . 9 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984 </TIMEX>. 
2783 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>, however , has agreed to cut its quota to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 . 9 % </NUMEX>previously . 
2863 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea </ENAMEX>provide <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>imported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>under the quota program . 
2986 The balance is supplied by a host of smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">exporters </ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Venezuela </ENAMEX>. 
3077 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about an extra 2 % </NUMEX>of the domestic steel market to give to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">suppliers </ENAMEX>in its quota talks . 
3186 That was essentially made up of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 % </NUMEX>increase in the overall quota program and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 % </NUMEX>from cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>' s allowance . 
3302 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Negotiators </ENAMEX>from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House </ENAMEX>trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office </ENAMEX>will repeat these quota negotiations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>when they will have another <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>steel market to allocate . 
3466 These optional <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 % </NUMEX>- a - year increases to the steel quota program are built into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>' s steel - quota program to give its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators </ENAMEX>leverage with foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">suppliers </ENAMEX>to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Traditional Industries Inc . </ENAMEX>said it expects to report a net loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter that ended June 30 </TIMEX>and is seeking new financing . 
148 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">seller </ENAMEX>of photographic products and services said it is considering a number of financing alternatives , including seeking increases in its credit lines . 
307 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Traditional </ENAMEX>declined to estimate the amount of the loss and would n't say if it expects to show a profit for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year </TIMEX>. 
425 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ended June 30 , 1988 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Traditional </ENAMEX>reported net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 9 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 21 </NUMEX>a share . 
525 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>did n't break out its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth - quarter </TIMEX>results . 
582 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest nine months </TIMEX>net income was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 7 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 31 </NUMEX>a share , on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44 . 3 million </NUMEX>. 
686 Separately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it would file a delayed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal - year </TIMEX>report with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission </ENAMEX>` within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">approximately 45 days </TIMEX>. ' 
834 It said the delay resulted from difficulties in resolving its accounting of a settlement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Trade Commission </ENAMEX>. 
958 Under an agreement filed in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>to settle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FTC </ENAMEX>objections to some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Traditional </ENAMEX>sales practices , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Traditional </ENAMEX>said it would establish a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 , 000 </NUMEX>trust fund to provide refunds to certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers </ENAMEX>.  

9 In response to your overly optimistic , outdated piece on how long unemployment lasts -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">People Patterns </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 20 </TIMEX>-RRB- : I am in the communications field , above entry level . 
178 I was laid off in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 1988 </TIMEX>, and after a thorough and exhausting job search , was hired in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 1989 </TIMEX>. 
283 My unemployment insurance ran out before I found a job ; I found cutbacks and layoffs in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>. 
389 The statistics quoted by the ` new ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Census Bureau </ENAMEX>report -LRB- garnered from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984 </TIMEX>to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>-RRB- are out of date , certainly as an average for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast </ENAMEX>, and possibly for the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>. 
578 I think what bothered me most about the piece was that there seemed to be an underlying attitude to tell your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers </ENAMEX>all is well - - if you ' re getting laid off do n't worry , and if you ' re unemployed , it ' s a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">seller </ENAMEX>' s market . 
803 To top it off , you captioned the graph showing the average number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months </TIMEX>in a job search as ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Time Off </ENAMEX>. '

9 When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>opened its doors to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979 </TIMEX>, toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>were among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>to march in . 
129 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today </TIMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>' products being made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Toys Council </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Ting </ENAMEX>, has suggested a new sourcing label : ` Made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies </ENAMEX>. ' 
334 The toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">colony </ENAMEX>. 
433 But in the wake of the shootings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing </ENAMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4 </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>. 
565 Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers </ENAMEX>stress that production has n't been affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>' s political turmoil , they are looking for additional sites . 
705 The toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>, and their foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>, cite uncertainty about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>' s economic and political policies . 
813 ` Nobody wants to have all his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs </ENAMEX>in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>basket , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Yeh </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Matchbox Group Ltd .  
956 Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matchbox </ENAMEX>and other leading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>were setting up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southeast Asia </ENAMEX>, especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Thailand </ENAMEX>, long before the massacre . 
1107 Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>. 
1216 By diversifying supply <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources </ENAMEX>, the toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>do n't intend to withdraw from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers </ENAMEX>and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>say . 
1338 It would n't be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past decade </TIMEX>. 
1457 A supply of cheap labor and the access to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">port </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>and support industries , such as printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>, have made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Guangdong </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">province </ENAMEX>a premier manufacturing site . 
1653 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South China </ENAMEX>is the most competitive source of toys in the world , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Hu </ENAMEX>, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd .  
1792 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>trade figures illustrate the toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>' reliance on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories </ENAMEX>across the border . 
1884 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>, exports of domestically produced toys and games fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK $ 10 . 05 billion </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US $ 1 . 29 billion </NUMEX>-RRB- . 
2000 But re - exports , mainly from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>, jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 % </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK $ 15 . 92 billion </NUMEX>. 
2068 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 ' s first seven months </TIMEX>, domestic exports fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29 % </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK $ 3 . 87 billion </NUMEX>, while re - exports rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 % </NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK $ 11 . 28 billion </NUMEX>. 
2195 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Manufacturers </ENAMEX>say there is no immediate substitute for southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 120 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>are employed by the toy industry . 
2334 ` For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few years </TIMEX>, like it or not , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>is going to be the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">supplier </ENAMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Young </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Perfecta Enterprises Ltd . </ENAMEX>, one of the first big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>to move across the border . 
2551 In the meantime , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southeast Asia </ENAMEX>. 
2656 Several big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>have established manufacturing joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Thailand </ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matchbox </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wah Shing </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kader Industrial Co . </ENAMEX>, the toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer </ENAMEX>headed by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ting </ENAMEX>. 
2834 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">the Philippines </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Indonesia </ENAMEX>also are being studied . 
2900 With the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community </ENAMEX>set to remove its internal trade barriers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992 </TIMEX>, several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>are beginning to consider <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Portugal </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece </ENAMEX>as possible manufacturing sites . 
3095 Worries about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>came just as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>' s toy industry was recovering from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>sales slump and bankruptcy filings by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Worlds of Wonder Inc . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coleco Industries Inc .  
3293 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers </ENAMEX>say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management . 
3502 The industry regards <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results . 
3607 Still , they long for a ` mega - hit ' toy to excite retail sales in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>' s biggest market for toys and games . 
3730 The closest thing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">colony </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>have to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>mega - hit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles </ENAMEX>series of action figures manufactured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Playmates Holdings Ltd .  
3906 Introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid - 1988 </TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">15 - centimeter </NUMEX>- tall plastic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles </ENAMEX>are based on an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>comic book and television series . 
4030 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Kwan </ENAMEX>, managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Playmates </ENAMEX>, says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Ninja Turtles </ENAMEX>have been sold , placing the reptilian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">warriors </ENAMEX>among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 </NUMEX>biggest - selling toys in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S .  </ENAMEX>
4196 Should sales continue to be strong through the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas season </TIMEX>, which accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 60 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>retail toy sales , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kwan </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Ninja Turtles </ENAMEX>could make <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>a record sales year for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Playmates </ENAMEX>. 
4401 Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers </ENAMEX>expect their results to improve only slightly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>. 
4498 Besides the lack of a fast - selling product , they cite the continued dominance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>market by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nintendo Entertainment System </ENAMEX>, an expensive video game made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nintendo Co . </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>. 
4684 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nintendo </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>have little money left to spend on other products . 
4753 Many of the toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>' problems started well before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4 </TIMEX>as a result of overstrained infrastructure and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing </ENAMEX>' s austerity programs launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last year </TIMEX>. 
4914 Toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>complain that electricity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Guangdong </ENAMEX>has been provided <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">only three days </TIMEX>a week in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months </TIMEX>, down from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five days </TIMEX>a week , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">province </ENAMEX>' s rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity . 
5134 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Manufacturers </ENAMEX>are upgrading standby power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants </ENAMEX>. 
5186 Bank credit for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>investments all but dried up following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4 </TIMEX>. 
5255 Also , concern exists that the harder - line <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership </ENAMEX>will tighten its control of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Guangdong </ENAMEX>, which has been the main laboratory for the open - door policy and economic reforms . 
5439 But , toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers </ENAMEX>and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">industrialists </ENAMEX>say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing </ENAMEX>will be restrained from tightening controls on export - oriented southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>. 
5578 They say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>' s trade deficit is widening and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Guangdong .  
5712 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kwan </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Playmates </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>' s wholesale prices in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 . 3 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier </TIMEX>and were up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 4 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous month </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Bank of Japan </ENAMEX>announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
157 The wholesale price index stood at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90 . 1 </NUMEX>, compared with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985 </TIMEX>base of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 </NUMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial Pipe Line Co . </ENAMEX>said it will delay a proposed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>- step , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">830 million Canadian - dollar </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US $ 705 . 6 million </NUMEX>-RRB- expansion of its system because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>' s output of crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil </ENAMEX>is shrinking . 
203 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>' s biggest oil pipeline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator </ENAMEX>and a major transporter of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>, said revised industry forecasts indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX>oil output will total <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">about 1 . 64 million barrels </NUMEX>a day by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991 </TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 % </NUMEX>lower than a previous estimate . 
459 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude </ENAMEX>production averaged <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">about 1 . 69 million barrels </NUMEX>a day during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 ' s first half </TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1 % </NUMEX>below the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>level . 
586 ` The capability of existing fields to deliver <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil </ENAMEX>is dropping , ' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers </ENAMEX>shift their emphasis to natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas </ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Watkins </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>for government and industry relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interhome Energy Inc .  
888 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watkins </ENAMEX>said volume on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial </ENAMEX>' s system is down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2 % </NUMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January </TIMEX>and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid - 1990s </TIMEX>. 
1064 ` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , ' he said . 
1138 Many of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers </ENAMEX>say the outlook for natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas </ENAMEX>is better than it is for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil </ENAMEX>, and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly . 
1311 The number of active drilling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">rigs </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>is down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago </TIMEX>, and the number of completed oil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wells </ENAMEX>is ` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Feick </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>of crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Calgary ' s Independent Petroleum Association of Canada </ENAMEX>, an industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group </ENAMEX>. 
1618 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watkins </ENAMEX>said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>. 
1765 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial </ENAMEX>transports <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75 % </NUMEX>of all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude </ENAMEX>produced in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 60 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial </ENAMEX>' s total volume consists of light <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude </ENAMEX>. 
1919 Nearly all of the crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil </ENAMEX>that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>is transported on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial </ENAMEX>' s system , whose main line runs from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Edmonton </ENAMEX>to major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U .

2171 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>' s current <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil </ENAMEX>exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>total <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">about 600 , 000 barrels </NUMEX>a day , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9 . 1 % </NUMEX>of net <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude </ENAMEX>imports , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lichtblau </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Petroleum Industry Research Foundation </ENAMEX>. 
2381 That ranks <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth </NUMEX>- largest source of imported <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude </ENAMEX>, behind <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Saudi Arabia </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nigeria </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico </ENAMEX>. 
2490 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lichtblau </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>' s declining crude output , combined with the fast - shrinking output of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude </ENAMEX>, will help intensify <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>reliance on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil </ENAMEX>from overseas , particularly the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Middle East </ENAMEX>. 
2683 ` It ' s very much a growing concern . 
2718 But when something is inevitable , you learn to live with it , ' he said . 
2791 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lichtblau </ENAMEX>stressed that the delay of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial </ENAMEX>' s proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>dependence on offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude </ENAMEX>, however , since <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian </ENAMEX>imports are limited in any case by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada </ENAMEX>' s falling output . 
3015 Under terms of its proposed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>- step expansion , which would have required regulatory approval , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial </ENAMEX>intended to add <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">200 , 000 barrels </NUMEX>a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a modest expansion by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991 </TIMEX>. 
3245 The system currently has a capacity of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">1 . 55 million barrels </NUMEX>a day .  

9 Citing a payment from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">supplier </ENAMEX>and strong sales of certain data - storage products , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxtor Corp . </ENAMEX>said earnings and revenue jumped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its second quarter ended Sept . 24 </TIMEX>. 
179 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of computer - data - storage products said net income rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 8 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23 cents </NUMEX>a share , from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier </TIMEX>net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 1 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five cents </NUMEX>a share . 
344 Revenue soared to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 117 million </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 81 . 5 million </NUMEX>. 
397 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxtor </ENAMEX>said its results were boosted by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 million </NUMEX>in payments received from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">supplier </ENAMEX>, for a certain line of products that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxtor </ENAMEX>is n't going to sell anymore . 
558 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxtor </ENAMEX>said effects from discontinuing the line may have a positive effect on future earnings and revenue . 
665 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman </ENAMEX>would n't elaborate , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said the discontinued product has never been a major source of revenue or profit . 
799 Operationally , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxtor </ENAMEX>benefited from robust sales of products that store data for high - end personal computers and computer workstations . 
938 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal first half </TIMEX>, net was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34 cents </NUMEX>a share , up from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year - earlier </TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 1 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
1065 Revenue rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 225 . 5 million </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 161 . 8 million </NUMEX>.  

9 As small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>peppered their mutual funds with phone calls over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>, big fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals : cash . 
182 Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>, the funds were n't swamped with heavy withdrawal requests . 
280 And many fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>. 
376 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity Investments </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s largest fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, telephone volume was up sharply , but it was still at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just half </NUMEX>the level of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>preceding <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>. 
556 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>said stock - fund redemptions were running at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one - third </NUMEX>the level <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>. 
661 As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon </TIMEX>, the redemptions represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 15 % </NUMEX>of the total cash position of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 billion </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>' s stock funds . 
806 ` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago </TIMEX>there were massive redemption levels over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>and a lot of fear around , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C . Bruce Johnstone </ENAMEX>, who runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity Investments </ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Equity - Income Fund </ENAMEX>. 
989 ` This feels more like a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>- shot deal . 
1028 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People </ENAMEX>are n't panicking . ' 
1056 The test may come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. 
1081 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s stock market sell - off came too late for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>to act . 
1153 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>have held off until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>because any fund exchanges made after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s close would take place at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>' s closing prices . 
1294 Stock fund redemptions during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>debacle did n't begin to snowball until after the market opened on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>. 
1415 But fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>say they ' re ready . 
1452 Many have raised cash levels , which act as a buffer against steep market declines . 
1535 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Gabelli </ENAMEX>, for instance , holds cash positions well above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 % </NUMEX>in several of his funds . 
1625 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Windsor Fund </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Neff </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mutual Series </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Price </ENAMEX>said they had raised their cash levels to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 % and 30 % </NUMEX>, respectively , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
1775 Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Lynch </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 . 7 billion </NUMEX>Magellan Fund , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s largest stock fund , built up cash to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 % </NUMEX>or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 850 million </NUMEX>. 
1914 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>reason is that after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two years of monthly </TIMEX>net redemptions , the fund posted net inflows of money from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>. 
2056 ` I ' ve let the money build up , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch </ENAMEX>said , who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes . 
2164 Not all funds have raised cash levels , of course . 
2214 As a group , stock funds held <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 . 2 % </NUMEX>of assets in cash as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>, the latest figures available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Investment Company Institute </ENAMEX>. 
2349 That was modestly higher than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 . 8 % and 9 . 2 % </NUMEX>levels in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September of 1987 </TIMEX>. 
2437 Also , persistent redemptions would force some fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>to dump stocks to raise cash . 
2529 But a strong level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX>withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around , fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>said . 
2632 A major reason is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>. 
2749 Stock - fund sales have rebounded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months </TIMEX>, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly </TIMEX>net purchases are still running at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>levels . 
2876 ` There ' s not nearly as much froth , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bogle </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vanguard Group Inc . </ENAMEX>, a big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Valley Forge </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa . </ENAMEX>, fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>. 
3003 Many fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>argue that now ' s the time to buy . 
3056 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Bajakian </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 8 billion </NUMEX>Wellington Fund , added to his positions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bristol - Myers Squibb </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Woolworth </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dun &amp; Bradstreet </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
3206 And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>he ' ll be looking to buy drug stocks like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eli Lilly </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pfizer </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Home Products </ENAMEX>whose dividend yields have been bolstered by stock declines . 
3365 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>' s Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch </ENAMEX>, for his part , snapped up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southern Co . </ENAMEX>shares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>after the stock got hammered . 
3469 If the market drops further <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>, he said he ' ll be buying blue chips such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bristol - Myers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg </ENAMEX>. 
3574 ` If they croak stocks like that , ' he said , it presents an opportunity that is ` the kind of thing you dream about . ' 
3691 Major mutual - fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups </ENAMEX>said phone calls were arriving at twice the normal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">weekend </TIMEX>pace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
3791 But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>were seeking share prices and other information . 
3859 Trading volume was only modestly higher than normal . 
3914 Still , fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups </ENAMEX>are n't taking any chances . 
3960 They hope to avoid the jammed phone lines and other snags that infuriated some fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>. 
4073 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity </ENAMEX>on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday </TIMEX>opened its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 </NUMEX>walk - in investor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">centers </ENAMEX>across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>. 
4153 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">centers </ENAMEX>normally are closed through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>. 
4206 In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Coast </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">centers </ENAMEX>will open at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 : 30 EDT this morning </TIMEX>, instead of the normal <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 : 30 </TIMEX>. 
4304 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T . Rowe Price Associates Inc . </ENAMEX>increased its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff </ENAMEX>of phone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives </ENAMEX>to handle investor requests . 
4408 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baltimore </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>noted that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>moved money from stock funds to money - market funds . 
4512 But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>seemed to be ` in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Norwitz </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>. 
4645 And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vanguard </ENAMEX>, among other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups </ENAMEX>, said it was adding more phone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>get through . 
4764 In an unusual move , several funds moved to calm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>with recordings on their toll - free phone lines . 
4870 ` We view -LCB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s -RCB- market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long - term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>, ' a recording at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gabelli &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>funds said over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>. 
5024 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Janus Group </ENAMEX>had a similar recording for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>. 
5081 Several fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>expect a rough market <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning </TIMEX>before prices stabilize . 
5163 Some early selling is likely to stem from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>and portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>who want to lock in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>' s fat profits . 
5283 Stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 % </NUMEX>through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lipper Analytical Services Inc .  
5400 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine Garzarelli </ENAMEX>, who runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 335 million </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sector Analysis Portfolio </ENAMEX>, predicts the market will open down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 50 </NUMEX>points on technical factors and ` some panic selling . ' 
5600 But she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>she expects the stock market wo n't decline <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 % to 15 % </NUMEX>from recent highs . 
5747 ` This is not a major crash , ' she said . 
5788 Nevertheless , Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garzarelli </ENAMEX>said she was swamped with phone calls over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend </TIMEX>from nervous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders </ENAMEX>. 
5899 ` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half </NUMEX>of them are really scared and want to sell , ' she said , ` but I ' m trying to talk them out of it . ' 
6001 She added , ` If they all were bullish , I ' d really be upset . ' 
6063 The backdrop to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s slide was markedly different from that of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>crash , fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>argue . 
6175 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago </TIMEX>, unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>, the dollar was weak , interest rates were rising and the market was very overvalued , they say . 
6300 ` From the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>' standpoint , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals </ENAMEX>learned a painful lesson . . . by selling at the lows ' on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Boesel </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 580 million </NUMEX>T . Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund . 
6521 This time , ` I do n't think we ' ll get a panic reaction .  

9 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arby ' s </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">franchisees </ENAMEX>said they formed an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association </ENAMEX>to oppose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami Beach </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Posner </ENAMEX>' s control of the restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain </ENAMEX>. 
154 The decision is the latest move in an escalating battle between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">franchisees </ENAMEX>and Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Posner </ENAMEX>that began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>. 
271 At the time , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">R . B . Partners Ltd . </ENAMEX>, consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arby ' s </ENAMEX>largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">franchisees </ENAMEX>, offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 200 million </NUMEX>to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arby ' s Inc . </ENAMEX>, which is part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DWG Corp .  
448 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DWG </ENAMEX>is a holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>controlled by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Posner </ENAMEX>. 
499 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">One week later </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard H . Roberts </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arby ' s </ENAMEX>, was fired in a dispute with Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Posner </ENAMEX>. 
626 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">franchisees </ENAMEX>announced the formation of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">association </ENAMEX>- - called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A . P . Association Inc . </ENAMEX>- - to ` preserve the integrity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arby ' s </ENAMEX>system . ' 
776 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">franchisees </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators </ENAMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 000 </NUMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 900 </NUMEX>franchised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arby ' s </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>, said : ` We have concluded that continued control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arby ' s </ENAMEX>by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Posner </ENAMEX>is totally unacceptable to us , because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arby </ENAMEX>' s system . 
1053 We support all efforts to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Posner </ENAMEX>from control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arby ' s Inc . </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arby ' s </ENAMEX>system . ' 
1154 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>said it would consider , among other things , withholding royalty payments and initiating a class - action lawsuit seeking court approval for the withholdings . 
1322 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Renee Mottram </ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DWG </ENAMEX>, responded : ` We do n't think any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>should disrupt a winning system or illegally interfere with existing contractual relationships for their own self - serving motives .  

9 Regarding the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 3 </TIMEX>letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor </ENAMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Lantos </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing </ENAMEX>, alleging : 
147 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 </NUMEX>. That your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 28 </TIMEX>editorial ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Kangaroo Committees </ENAMEX>' was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading . 
257 I thought your editorial was factually accurate and deliberately elucidative . 
337 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 </NUMEX>. That Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos </ENAMEX>supported the rights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses </ENAMEX>to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment </ENAMEX>. 
425 Yes , he did . 
438 As I watched him on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">C - Span </ENAMEX>, I heard him speak those lovely words about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights </ENAMEX>, which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings . 
582 He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution </ENAMEX>. 
686 He used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 56 </NUMEX>words defending the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses </ENAMEX>' constitutional rights . 
759 Unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 , 000 </NUMEX>words heaping scorn on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses </ENAMEX>for exercising the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth </ENAMEX>. 
882 He sandwiched his praise of constitutional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">meat </ENAMEX>between large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">loaves </ENAMEX>of bilious commentary . 
974 As your editorial rightly pointed out , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Pierce </ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lance Wilson </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce </ENAMEX>' s former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide </ENAMEX>, ` are currently being held up to scorn for taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment </ENAMEX>. ' 
1165 That certainly is not the supposed ` distorted reading ' indicated by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos </ENAMEX>. 
1247 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 </NUMEX>. That his ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee </ENAMEX>does not deal with any possible criminal activity at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD </ENAMEX>. 
1328 My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues </ENAMEX>and I fully realize we are not a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>. . . etc . ' 
1395 Absolute rubbish . 
1413 By any ` reasonable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>' criterion , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos </ENAMEX>and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues </ENAMEX>have a whole bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>tried and convicted . 
1528 Apparently , their verdict is in . 
1561 Right now they ' re pursuing evidence . 
1598 That ' s not a bad way to proceed , just somewhat different from standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>practice . 
1690 How was that practice referred to when I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school </ENAMEX>? 
1746 Ah , yes , something called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Star Chamber </ENAMEX>. 
1790 Of course , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos </ENAMEX>doth protest that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee </ENAMEX>simply seeks information for legislative change . 
1896 No doubt that ' s partially true . 
1928 Everything that Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos </ENAMEX>says in his letter is partially true . 
1993 He ' s right about his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee </ENAMEX>' s responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>. 
2111 But if his explanation of motivation is true , why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity ? 
2228 Why not simply questions designed to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources </ENAMEX>and causes of waste and inefficiency ? 
2320 Such as , what happened when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>wanted to know about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 </NUMEX>toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost ? 
2430 No , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos </ENAMEX>' s complaints simply wo n't wash . 
2479 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 </NUMEX>. That the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal </ENAMEX>defends ` the sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence - peddling and abuse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public </ENAMEX>that took place while Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce </ENAMEX>was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD </ENAMEX>, ' etc . and so forth . 
2668 No , to my mind , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal </ENAMEX>did not ` defend sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence - peddling and abuse of the public trust . . 
2801 . ' it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense . 
2884 The problem , which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal </ENAMEX>so rightly pointed out in a number of articles , is not the likes of Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos </ENAMEX>, who after all is really a bit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player </ENAMEX>on the stage , but the attempt by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>to enhance itself into a quasi - parliamentary \/ judicial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">body </ENAMEX>. 
3134 -LRB- Of course , we ' ve also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective . -RRB- 
3205 The system is the problem , not an individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member </ENAMEX>. 
3258 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals </ENAMEX>can always have their hands slapped . 
3307 It ' s when such slapping does n't occur that we ' ve got trouble . 
3371 I do not by any means defend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management </ENAMEX>. 
3416 But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX>notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -LRB- and , yes , maybe criminality -RRB- within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD </ENAMEX>could possibly generate . 
3645 The last time I saw a similar congressional hearing was when ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tail Gunner Joe ' McCarthy </ENAMEX>did his work . 
3749 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Weber  
3765 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Parsippany </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . J .  
3784 I disagree with the statement by Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos </ENAMEX>that one should not draw an adverse inference against former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>who assert their <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment </ENAMEX>privilege against self - incrimination in congressional hearings . 
4002 The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment </ENAMEX>states in relevant part that no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person </ENAMEX>` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness </ENAMEX>against himself . ' 
4138 This privilege against self - incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant </ENAMEX>who chooses not to testify . 
4283 Thus , in a criminal case , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor </ENAMEX>can not comment on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant </ENAMEX>' s failure to testify nor can the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant </ENAMEX>be compelled to take the stand as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness </ENAMEX>, thus forcing him to ` take the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth </ENAMEX>. ' 
4478 The privilege , however , has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant </ENAMEX>in criminal matters only . 
4610 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court </ENAMEX>and some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>have specifically recognized that ` the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment </ENAMEX>does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">party </ENAMEX>to a civil cause . ' 
4794 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baxter </ENAMEX>v . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmingiano </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">425 U . S . 308 </ENAMEX>-LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976 </TIMEX>-RRB- . 
4838 Thus , in a civil case , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant </ENAMEX>may be called as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness </ENAMEX>, he may be forced to testify or take the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth </ENAMEX>, and his taking of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth </ENAMEX>may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter . 
5056 He may take the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth </ENAMEX>in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution . 
5207 Allowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant </ENAMEX>to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth </ENAMEX>in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one ' s testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . 
5508 Absent the risk of such prosecution , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>may order the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant </ENAMEX>to testify . 
5591 Thus , when Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce </ENAMEX>asserted the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth </ENAMEX>in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>must conclude that he held a good - faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . 
5885 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public </ENAMEX>have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce </ENAMEX>' s own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime . 
6080 Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment </ENAMEX>shield against self - incrimination .

9 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>, trying to blunt growing demands from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Western Europe </ENAMEX>for a relaxation of controls on exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">bloc </ENAMEX>, is questioning whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ing . C . Olivetti &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>supplied militarily valuable technology to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets </ENAMEX>. 
258 Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Western European </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">members </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls </ENAMEX>, the unofficial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">forum </ENAMEX>through which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>and its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">allies </ENAMEX>align their export - control policies , are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 25 </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">26 </TIMEX>. 
551 They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high - technology products . 
693 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>says it wants to see evidence that all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">members </ENAMEX>are complying fully with existing export - control procedures before it will support further liberalization . 
881 To make its point , it is challenging the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>to explain reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti </ENAMEX>may have supplied the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union </ENAMEX>with sophisticated computer - driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft </ENAMEX>. 
1109 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London Sunday Times </ENAMEX>, which first reported the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>concerns , cited a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>intelligence report as the source of the allegations that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti </ENAMEX>exported <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 million </NUMEX>in ` embargoed , state - of - the - art , flexible manufacturing systems to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX>aviation industry . ' 
1373 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti </ENAMEX>reportedly began shipping these tools in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984 </TIMEX>. 
1431 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>acknowledged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>is discussing the allegations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian </ENAMEX>government and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom </ENAMEX>, but declined to confirm any details . 
1593 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francesco Cossiga </ENAMEX>promised a quick investigation into whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti </ENAMEX>broke <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom </ENAMEX>rules . 
1701 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>called his attention to the matter during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader </ENAMEX>' s visit here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>. 
1803 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti </ENAMEX>has denied that it violated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom </ENAMEX>rules , asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities </ENAMEX>. 
1944 Although the legality of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export - control hawks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon </ENAMEX>and the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community </ENAMEX>. 
2144 ` It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom </ENAMEX>meeting , ' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyist </ENAMEX>for a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>. 
2304 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>has sent conflicting signals about its export - control policies , reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agencies </ENAMEX>. 
2456 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last summer </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>moved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">North Atlantic Treaty Organization </ENAMEX>meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom </ENAMEX>embargo of strategic goods . 
2681 But more recently , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department </ENAMEX>openly feuded over the extent to which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom </ENAMEX>should liberalize exports of personal computers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">bloc </ENAMEX>. 
2849 However , these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agencies </ENAMEX>generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization . 
2956 ` There ' s no evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX>program to -LRB- illegally -RRB- acquire Western technology has diminished , ' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase Manhattan Bank </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willard Butcher </ENAMEX>is a conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker </ENAMEX>and a loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican </ENAMEX>, but on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning </TIMEX>he had few kind words for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>' s economic policy - making . 
195 ` There are some very significant issues out there , such as the fiscal deficit , the trade deficit , our relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>, that have to be the subject of major initiatives , ' he said in an interview . 
395 ` I ' d like to see that initiative , and I have n't . 
444 There is n't a big shot , an agenda . ' 
482 <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A few hours later </TIMEX>, the stock market dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 </NUMEX>points . 
540 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Politicians </ENAMEX>tried to finger each other for the blame , although many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>was singly responsible for Wall Street ' s woes . 
686 But Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butcher </ENAMEX>' s comments make one thing clear : Some on Wall Street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy . 
807 Consider this : 
824 - - By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 : 59 p . m . tonight </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>must order <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16 billion </NUMEX>of automatic , across - the - board cuts in government spending to comply with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm - Rudman </ENAMEX>budget law . 
991 The cuts are necessary because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>have failed to reach agreement on a deficit - cutting bill . 
1112 ` We simply do n't have strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership </ENAMEX>to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Budget Committee </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Panetta </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>-RRB- said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC News </ENAMEX>' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Meet the Press </ENAMEX>. ' 
1313 - - For the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two weeks </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve </ENAMEX>have been engaged in a semi - public battle over international economic policy . 
1466 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>has been resisting . 
1555 ` One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury Department </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board </ENAMEX>, ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Kudlow </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear , Stearns &amp; Co . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC </ENAMEX>' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">This Week </ENAMEX>. ' 
1769 - - The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers . 
1883 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Skinner </ENAMEX>forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northwest Airlines </ENAMEX>to reduce a stake held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KLM Royal Dutch Airlines </ENAMEX>. 
2010 But he has since run into opposition from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House </ENAMEX>over that decision . 
2105 And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines </ENAMEX>, which includes a big stake by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways PLC </ENAMEX>. 
2236 Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>say uncertainty about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>' s anti - takeover policy was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>reason that financing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines </ENAMEX>takeover fell through - - the event that triggered the market drop . 
2429 In many ways , the backdrop to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s stock decline is eerily similar to that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508 </NUMEX>- point crash . 
2543 Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days </TIMEX>of taking hold . 
2656 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>was locked in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve </ENAMEX>. 
2817 And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers - - then by the tax - writing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Ways and Means Committee </ENAMEX>rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department </ENAMEX>- - were making markets nervous . 
3005 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers </ENAMEX>to the table for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>budget summit , resulting in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two - year </TIMEX>plan to reduce the deficit by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 76 billion </NUMEX>- - even though the deficit actually rose by nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 billion </NUMEX>during that period . 
3282 But , barring further drops in the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>, a similar outcome does n't seem likely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
3383 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawmakers </ENAMEX>and administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>agree that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">sides </ENAMEX>back to the table to try to reach a deficit - reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far - reaching than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring </TIMEX>' s gimmick - ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented . 
3684 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that , as everyone learned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, the economy and the market can survive a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one - day </TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508 </NUMEX>- point tumble . 
3859 ` Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1929 </TIMEX>, that we were looking at a recession , ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panetta </ENAMEX>said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>in an interview . 
4002 ` That did not happen . 
4024 They learned they could survive it without much problem . ' 
4084 But administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>privately agree with Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panetta </ENAMEX>, who said a precipitous drop <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>` is going to force the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . ' 
4279 In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around . 
4337 ` There is an underlying concern on the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>- - and there should be - that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>has been unwilling to cut what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>asked us to cut , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Finance Committee </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>-RRB- . 
4653 Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 </NUMEX>- point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House </ENAMEX>Budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman </ENAMEX>over the capital - gains fight . 
4872 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Hill </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats </ENAMEX>are particularly angry over Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>' s claim that the capital - gains cut was part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April </TIMEX>' s budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit - reduction legislation . 
5070 ` There is no prospect of any so - called grand compromise or deal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>because the administration simply did n't live up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>' s deal , ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>Majority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leader </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine </ENAMEX>-RRB- said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS News </ENAMEX>' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Face the Nation </ENAMEX>. ' 
5316 During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>' s maneuverings on the deficit - cutting bill and the capital - gains issue , there were signs that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>were at odds . 
5483 At the very moment that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans </ENAMEX>were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit - reduction legislation , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlin Fitzwater </ENAMEX>told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters </ENAMEX>that it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>' s policy to include it . 
5721 When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oregon </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Packwood </ENAMEX>, the ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member </ENAMEX>of the tax - writing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Finance Committee </ENAMEX>, hailed it . 
5901 Asked if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>agreed , he curtly replied : ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">adminstration </ENAMEX>will have to speak for itself . ' 
6009 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s market tumble could spur action on reconciling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>versions of the deficit - reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow </TIMEX>at the soonest . 
6201 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans </ENAMEX>expressed the hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>would follow the lead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>, which on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990 </TIMEX>deficit . 
6421 ` The market needs a strong signal that we ' re serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Representatives </ENAMEX>to strip their bill ' of similar provisions , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Rudman </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . H . </ENAMEX>-RRB- . said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>. 
6656 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House Office of Management and Budget </ENAMEX>, whose calculations determine whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm - Rudman </ENAMEX>targets are met , estimated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>- passed deficit - reduction measure would cut the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990 </TIMEX>shortfall by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 . 2 billion </NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congressional Budget Office </ENAMEX>' s estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 . 0 billion </NUMEX>. 
6963 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panetta </ENAMEX>said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">OMB </ENAMEX>' s figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across - the - board cuts , but added : ` We ' re getting very close to the margins here . ' 
7124 No one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>was willing to take the blame for provoking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s drop in the stock market . 
7224 But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players </ENAMEX>were quick to seize the moment . 
7273 Before the sun had set on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rahn </ENAMEX>, the supply - side chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Chamber of Commerce </ENAMEX>, issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>decision to postpone action on capital gains . 
7502 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors </ENAMEX>, who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell , were spooked , ' he said . 
7618 ` There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital - gains tax cut , ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell </ENAMEX>said during his television appearance , ` but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Diamond Shamrock Offshore Partners </ENAMEX>said it had discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas </ENAMEX>offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Louisiana </ENAMEX>. 
93 The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">well </ENAMEX>flowed at a rate of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">2 . 016 million cubic feet </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas </ENAMEX>a day through a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">16 64 - inch </NUMEX>opening at depths <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">between 5 , 782 and 5 , 824 feet </NUMEX>. 
232 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Diamond Shamrock </ENAMEX>is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator </ENAMEX>, with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 % </NUMEX>interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">well </ENAMEX>. 
302 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Diamond Shamrock Offshore </ENAMEX>' s stock rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 . 5 cents </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 . 25 </NUMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>composite trading .  

9 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bronx </ENAMEX>has a wonderful botanical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">garden </ENAMEX>, a great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">zoo </ENAMEX>, its own charming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Little Italy </ENAMEX>-LRB- on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Arthur Avenue </ENAMEX>-RRB- and , of course , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Yankees </ENAMEX>. 
144 However , most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>, having been subjected to news footage of the devastated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">South Bronx </ENAMEX>, look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">borough </ENAMEX>the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Wolfe </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman McCoy </ENAMEX>did in ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Bonfire of the Vanities </ENAMEX>' - - as a wrong turn into hell . 
354 But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Cunningham </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bronx </ENAMEX>, her childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bronx </ENAMEX>of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">' 50s </TIMEX>, is something else altogether . 
447 In a lovely , novelistic memoir , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Sleeping Arrangements </ENAMEX>' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Knopf </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">195 </NUMEX>pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18 . 95 </NUMEX>-RRB- , she remembers an exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">playground </ENAMEX>, peopled mainly by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eccentrics </ENAMEX>and the occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Catholic </ENAMEX>-LRB- real oddballs like her sexpot <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend </ENAMEX>, the hell - kitten <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana </ENAMEX>, age <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">five </TIMEX>-RRB- . 
706 Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunningham </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright </ENAMEX>, has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall . 
804 She transforms her ` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bronx </ENAMEX>of the emotions , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">place </ENAMEX>where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria ' into the ` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Babylonian Bronx </ENAMEX>, ' a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue . 
1016 In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Babylonian Bronx </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish </ENAMEX>working - class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>lived in drab , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet </ENAMEX>- style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings </ENAMEX>` glamorized ' with names like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">AnaMor Towers </ENAMEX>-LRB- after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris Snezak </ENAMEX>-RRB- , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lobbies </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">hallways </ENAMEX>were decorated with murals of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Syrians </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greeks </ENAMEX>, friezes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pompeii </ENAMEX>. 
1296 For Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunningham </ENAMEX>the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">AnaMor Towers </ENAMEX>as a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl </ENAMEX>: ` . . . outwardly ordinary , inwardly ornate , owing all inspiration to heathen cultures . ' 
1517 Sharp - witted and funny but never mean , she ' s a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">memorialist </ENAMEX>a bit like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman Capote </ENAMEX>, if he ' d been <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female </ENAMEX>and less bitchy . 
1652 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Lily </ENAMEX>, as Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunningham </ENAMEX>calls herself in the book , really was n't ordinary . 
1734 She was raised , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first eight years </TIMEX>, by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie </ENAMEX>, whom she remembers as a loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liar </ENAMEX>, who realigned history to explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father </ENAMEX>did n't live with them . 
1910 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie </ENAMEX>reinvented this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>, who may or may not have known about his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child </ENAMEX>, as a war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily </ENAMEX>' s benefit . 
2020 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie </ENAMEX>died young and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily </ENAMEX>has remembered her as a romantic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure </ENAMEX>, who did n't interfere much with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child </ENAMEX>' s education on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets </ENAMEX>. 
2156 The games <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bronx </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children </ENAMEX>played -LRB- holding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids </ENAMEX>down and stripping them , for example -RRB- seem tame by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>' s crack standards , but Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunningham </ENAMEX>makes it all sound like a great adventure . 
2340 ` Without official knowledge of sex or death , we flirted with both , ' she writes . 
2420 She analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families </ENAMEX>by their sleeping arrangements . 
2474 Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan </ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents </ENAMEX>kept reminding her she was unwanted , slept on a narrow bed wedged into her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">bedroom </ENAMEX>, as though she were a temporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor </ENAMEX>. 
2639 Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father </ENAMEX>was a professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thief </ENAMEX>; they did n't seem to have any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">bedrooms </ENAMEX>at all . 
2739 Maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily </ENAMEX>became so obsessed with where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting . 
2845 When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie </ENAMEX>died , her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncles </ENAMEX>moved in - - and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements . 
2949 They painted the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartment </ENAMEX>orange , pink and white , according to her instructions . 
3031 With loving detail she recalls her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Gabe </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Orthodox Jew </ENAMEX>and song <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lyricist </ENAMEX>-LRB- who rhymed river with liver in a love song -RRB- ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Len </ENAMEX>, a mysterious part - time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator </ENAMEX>who looked like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln </ENAMEX>and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope , like an ` undercover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX>on a good - will mission . ' 
3345 They came by their strangeness honestly . 
3386 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother </ENAMEX>, no cookie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baker </ENAMEX>, excised the heads of disliked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives </ENAMEX>from the family album , and lugged around her perennial work - in - progress , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Philosophy for Women </ENAMEX>. ' 
3562 The book loses some momentum toward the end , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily </ENAMEX>becomes more preoccupied with dating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys </ENAMEX>and less with her delightfully weird <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family </ENAMEX>. 
3704 For the most part , though , there ' s much pleasure in her saucy , poignant probe into the mysteries of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Babylonian Bronx </ENAMEX>. 
3828 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bronx </ENAMEX>also figures in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Jay Friedman </ENAMEX>' s latest novel , which flashes back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">' 50s </TIMEX>. 
3937 But both the past and present worlds of ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Current Climate </ENAMEX>' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atlantic Monthly Press </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 </NUMEX>pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18 . 95 </NUMEX>-RRB- feel cramped and static . 
4070 For his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth </NUMEX>novel , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman </ENAMEX>tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972 </TIMEX>work , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">About Harry Towns </ENAMEX>. ' 
4180 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry </ENAMEX>is now a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">57 - year - old </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer </ENAMEX>, whose continuing flirtation with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs </ENAMEX>and marginal types in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>seems quaintly out - of - synch . 
4328 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry </ENAMEX>fondly remembers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the ` old ' days of the early ' 70s </TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>like his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Travis </ENAMEX>would take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrist </ENAMEX>on a date to analyze what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Travis </ENAMEX>was doing wrong . 
4496 ` An <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">L . A . </ENAMEX>solution , ' explains Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman </ENAMEX>. 
4541 Line by line Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman </ENAMEX>' s weary cynicism can be amusing , especially when he ' s riffing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood </ENAMEX>social scheme - - the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>size each other up , immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it . 
4766 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry </ENAMEX>has avoided all that by living in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Long Island </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">suburb </ENAMEX>with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife </ENAMEX>, who ' s so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband </ENAMEX>disappears for drug - seeking forays into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan </ENAMEX>. 
4991 But it does n't take too many lines to figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry </ENAMEX>out . 
5047 He ' s a bore .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freeport - McMoRan Inc . </ENAMEX>said a temporary cessation of operations at its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Sunshine Bridge </ENAMEX>uranium - recovery <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Donaldsonville </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">La . </ENAMEX>, will result in slight earnings improvement to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freeport - McMoRan Resource Partners Limited Partnership </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>. 
277 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>did n't elaborate . 
309 The diversified energy and minerals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern </ENAMEX>said that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary mothballing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>, but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>can be reactivated quickly when the market improves . 
521 <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">More than 400 , 000 pounds </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">uranium </ENAMEX>a year have been produced at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility </ENAMEX>during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past seven years </TIMEX>. 
628 A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second </NUMEX>uranium - recovery <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Uncle Sam </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">La . </ENAMEX>, that produces <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">more than 700 , 000 pounds </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">uranium </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually </TIMEX>, will continue to operate . 
767 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freeport - McMoRan </ENAMEX>said the shutdown wo n't affect sales volumes under long - term sales contracts of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freeport Uranium Recovery Co . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>, but will reduce the amount of product sold on the spot market . 
967 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freeport - McMoRan Resource Partners </ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner </ENAMEX>of the uranium - recovery technology , receives royalty payments .  

9 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 </NUMEX>- point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 October </TIMEX>crash , and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly . 
228 Still , the lesson is about the same : On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the 13th </TIMEX>, the market was spooked by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>. 
325 The consensus along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street </ENAMEX>seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>takeover , and it ' s certainly true the rout began immediately after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>trading halt . 
524 Still , the consensus seems almost as wide that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business </ENAMEX>. 
648 This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones </ENAMEX>ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats </ENAMEX>in stalling the capital gains tax cut . 
832 The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits -LRB- all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not ` ordinary income ' -RRB- . 
1023 And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>. 
1126 <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">An hour </TIMEX>before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 4 billion </NUMEX>in tax increases without a capital gains cut . 
1282 There is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill . 
1386 It would be a good thing if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>started to decide issues <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>- by - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>on their individual merits without trickery . 
1504 For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up - or - down vote . 
1594 Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders </ENAMEX>have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens , promises of a cleaner bill are suspect . 
1710 Especially so since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>has been weakened by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama </ENAMEX>fiasco . 
1787 To the extent that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>' s sticky fingers . 
1908 As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course , at some point the market will start to reject them . 
2040 But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines </ENAMEX>are scarcely a clear case , given anti - takeover mischief by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner </ENAMEX>, who professes to believe safety will be compromised if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KLM </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways </ENAMEX>own interests in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>that fly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">airplanes </ENAMEX>. 
2281 Worse , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>has started to jump on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner </ENAMEX>bandwagon . 
2343 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Oberstar </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat </ENAMEX>who chairs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Public Works and Transportation Committee </ENAMEX>' s aviation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee </ENAMEX>, has put an anti - airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Air Lines </ENAMEX>bids . 
2607 It would give Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">up to 50 days </TIMEX>to ` review ' any bid for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % </NUMEX>or more of the voting stock of any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier </ENAMEX>with revenues of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion </NUMEX>or more . 
2760 So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL </ENAMEX>deal has problems , and the market loses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 </NUMEX>points . 
2823 Congratulations , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary </ENAMEX>and Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Congressman </ENAMEX>. 
2877 In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash , remember , the market was shaken by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Rostenkowski </ENAMEX>proposal to tax takeovers out of existance . 
2996 Even more important , in our view , was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>' s threat to thrash the dollar . 
3078 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>is doing the same thing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>; thankfully , the dollar is not under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>- style pressure . 
3181 Also , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>are in better shape <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>to survive selling binges . 
3261 They are better capitalized . 
3290 They are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape lags and clearing and settlement delays . 
3398 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed </ENAMEX>promises any needed liquidity . 
3437 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board </ENAMEX>' s liaison with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade </ENAMEX>has improved ; it will be interesting to learn if ` circuit breakers ' prove to be a good idea . 
3586 In any event , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders </ENAMEX>see stocks as underpriced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>, unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>. 
3661 There is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be cured by a little coherence and common sense in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>. 
3774 But on the bearish side , that may be too much to expect .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imperial Corp . of America </ENAMEX>withdrew from regulators its application to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley Federal </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches </ENAMEX>, leaving the transaction in limbo . 
196 The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imperial Corp . </ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>withdrew its application from the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of Thrift Supervision </ENAMEX>because of an informal notice that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imperial </ENAMEX>' s thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>failed to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Community Reinvestment Act </ENAMEX>requirements . 
497 The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Community Reinvestment Act </ENAMEX>requires savings and loan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">associations </ENAMEX>to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received . 
640 The transaction , announced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>, included <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 146 million </NUMEX>in deposits at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">San Joaquin Valley </ENAMEX>. 
774 Terms were n't disclosed , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley Federal </ENAMEX>had said it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 million </NUMEX>in operating costs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually </TIMEX>. 
928 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley Federal </ENAMEX>said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>that it is considering whether to seek another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyer </ENAMEX>for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches </ENAMEX>or to pursue the transaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imperial Corp . </ENAMEX>, which said it is attempting to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Community Reinvestment Act </ENAMEX>requirements . 
1154 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley Federal </ENAMEX>, with assets of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 3 billion </NUMEX>, is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Van Nuys </ENAMEX>. 
1221 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imperial Corp . </ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Diego </ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imperial Savings &amp; Loan </ENAMEX>. 
1299 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first six months of the year </TIMEX>it posted a net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33 . 1 million </NUMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ports of Call Inc . </ENAMEX>reached agreements to sell its remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyers </ENAMEX>that were n't disclosed . 
120 The agreements bring to a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine </NUMEX>the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">planes </ENAMEX>the travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>has sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>as part of a restructuring . 
247 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said a portion of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 32 million </NUMEX>realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended air - charter operations . 
440 Earlier the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>announced it would sell its aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fleet </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing Co . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">707s </ENAMEX>because of increasing maintenance costs .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avis Inc . </ENAMEX>, following rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hertz Corp . </ENAMEX>' s lead , said it is backing out of frequent - flier programs with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines </ENAMEX>. 
130 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Garden City </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N . Y . </ENAMEX>, car - rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it wo n't renew contracts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NWA Inc . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northwest Airlines </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan Am Corp . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan American World Airways </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Midway Airlines </ENAMEX>at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of this year </TIMEX>. 
337 But it remains involved in programs with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta Air Lines </ENAMEX>. 
437 Industry estimates put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avis </ENAMEX>' s annual cost of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>programs at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 8 million and $ 14 million </NUMEX>. 
539 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avis </ENAMEX>would n't specify the costs but said the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines </ENAMEX>being dropped account for ` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">far less than half </NUMEX>' of the total . 
678 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Budget Rent a Car Corp . </ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Car Rental Systems Inc . </ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis </ENAMEX>, both said they had no plans to follow suit . 
813 In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Budget </ENAMEX>indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">renters </ENAMEX>earn frequent - flier miles and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fliers </ENAMEX>can get car - rental discounts . 
984 ` I can not see how this news by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hertz </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avis </ENAMEX>can not benefit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Budget </ENAMEX>' s programs , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Wilson </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Budget </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>, marketing planning . 
1127 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northwest </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Midway </ENAMEX>are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines </ENAMEX>with which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Budget </ENAMEX>has agreements . 
1213 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National </ENAMEX>also participates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northwest </ENAMEX>frequent - flier program along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines </ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir Group Inc . </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>. 
1366 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A month ago </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hertz </ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Park Ridge </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N .

1683 At the time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hertz </ENAMEX>said its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>fees to those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines </ENAMEX>amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million </NUMEX>and that the value of redeemed awards topped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million </NUMEX>. 
1823 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>, however , doubt the numbers were that high . 
1892 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Budget </ENAMEX>said its frequent - flier costs are ` substantially below ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avis </ENAMEX>' s level . 
1971 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert D . Cardillo </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avis </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>of marketing , said , ` The proliferation and costs attached to -LCB- frequent - flier programs -RCB- have significantly diminished their value . ' 
2144 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year </TIMEX>has been difficult for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hertz </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avis </ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Finnie </ENAMEX>, car - rental industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alex . Brown &amp; Sons </ENAMEX>. 
2270 ` They ' ve been looking to get their costs down , and this is a fairly sensible way to do it , ' he said .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MedChem Products Inc . </ENAMEX>said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . S . District Court </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston </ENAMEX>ruled that a challenge by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MedChem </ENAMEX>to the validity of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>patent held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pharmacia Inc . </ENAMEX>was ` without merit . ' 
181 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pharmacia </ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Upsala </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Sweden </ENAMEX>, had charged in a lawsuit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MedChem </ENAMEX>that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MedChem </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">AMVISC </ENAMEX>product line infringes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pharmacia </ENAMEX>patent . 
328 The patent is related to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">hyaluronic acid </ENAMEX>, a rooster - comb extract used in eye surgery . 
414 In its lawsuit , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pharmacia </ENAMEX>is seeking unspecified damages and a preliminary injunction to block <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MedChem </ENAMEX>from selling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">AMVISC </ENAMEX>products . 
551 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MedChem </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said the products contribute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a third </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MedChem </ENAMEX>' s sales and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % to 20 % </NUMEX>of its earnings . 
667 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ended Aug . 31 , 1988 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MedChem </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 9 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">72 cents </NUMEX>a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 . 4 million </NUMEX>. 
779 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MedChem </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>' s ruling was issued as part of a ` <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>- phase trial ' in the patent - infringement proceedings and concerns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one </NUMEX>of its defenses in the case . 
945 It said it is considering ` all of its options in light of the decision , including a possible appeal . ' 
1047 The medical - products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>added that it plans to ` assert its other defenses ' against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pharmacia </ENAMEX>' s lawsuit , including the claim that it has n't infringed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pharmacia </ENAMEX>' s patent . 
1226 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MedChem </ENAMEX>said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>scheduled a conference for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Monday </TIMEX>- - to set a date for proceedings on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pharmacia </ENAMEX>' s motion for a preliminary injunction .  

9 This small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">suburb </ENAMEX>' s got trouble . 
49 Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool </ENAMEX>. 
125 More than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">30 years ago </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Hill </ENAMEX>, the con <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredith Willson </ENAMEX>' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Music Man </ENAMEX>, ' warned the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">River City </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa </ENAMEX>, against the game . 
278 Now kindred spirits on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Addison </ENAMEX>' s town <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council </ENAMEX>have barred the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town </ENAMEX>' s fanciest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Grand Kempinski </ENAMEX>, from installing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>free pool tables in its new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lounge </ENAMEX>. 
444 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynn Spruill </ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council </ENAMEX>said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">halls </ENAMEX>along <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Addison </ENAMEX>' s main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street </ENAMEX>. 
601 And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor </ENAMEX>, in an admonition that bears a rhythmic resemblance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill </ENAMEX>' s , warned that ` <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">alcohol </ENAMEX>leads to betting , which leads to fights . ' 
749 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council </ENAMEX>' s action is yet another blow to a sport that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans </ENAMEX>claim has been maligned unjustly for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years </TIMEX>. 
859 ` Obviously they ' re not in touch with what ' s going on , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Manske </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Pocket Billiards Association </ENAMEX>. 
992 <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Pool </ENAMEX>is hot in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>, he insists , where ` upscale , suit - and - tie places ' are adding tables . 
1097 With <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>' s tougher drunk driving laws , he adds , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>do n't want to just sit around and drink . ' 
1199 Besides , rowdy behavior seems unlikely at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Grand Kempinski </ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms </ENAMEX>average <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 </NUMEX>a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 50 </NUMEX>a pop . 
1342 At the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lounge </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Dyer </ENAMEX>wo n't admit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons </ENAMEX>in jeans , T - shirts or tennis shoes . 
1438 But a majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Addison </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council </ENAMEX>did n't buy those arguments . 
1504 Introducing <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool </ENAMEX>, argued <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Councilwoman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riley Reinker </ENAMEX>, would be ` dangerous . 
1578 It would open a can of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms </ENAMEX>. ' 
1611 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Addison </ENAMEX>is no stranger to cans of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms </ENAMEX>, either . 
1660 After its previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor </ENAMEX>committed suicide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, an investigation disclosed that town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>regularly voted on their own projects , gave special favors to developer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends </ENAMEX>and dipped into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town </ENAMEX>' s coffers for trips and retreats . 
1902 The revelations embarrassed town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>, although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">media </ENAMEX>suggested . 
2027 Now comes the pool flap . 
2054 ` I think there ' s some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>worried about something pretty ridiculous , ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Councilman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Nolan </ENAMEX>says . 
2155 ` I thought this was all taken care of in ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Music Man </ENAMEX>.  

9 Just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks , Wall Street suffered another severe attack of nerves . 
114 Does this signal another <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday </ENAMEX>is coming ? 
163 Or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity , just like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 19 , 1987 </TIMEX>, eventually turned out to be ? 
267 Here ' s what several leading market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts </ENAMEX>and money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>say about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s action , what happens next and what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>should do . 
406 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Granville </ENAMEX>. 
424 ` I ' m the only one who said there would be an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October </TIMEX>massacre , all through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late August </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>, ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Granville </ENAMEX>, once a widely followed market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru </ENAMEX>and still a well - known newsletter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer </ENAMEX>. 
626 ` Everyone will tell you that this time is different from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, ' he says . 
699 ` Well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same . 
773 If you ' re a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technician </ENAMEX>, you obey the signals . 
819 Right now they ' re telling me to get the hell out and stay out . 
882 I see no major support until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2200 </TIMEX>. 
917 I see a possibility of going to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2200 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month </TIMEX>. ' 
969 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Granville </ENAMEX>says he would n't even think of buying until at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700 </NUMEX>stocks have hit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">52 - week </TIMEX>lows ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100 </NUMEX>stocks hit new lows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
1115 ` Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>, ' he says , ` have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like . ' 
1192 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine Garzarelli </ENAMEX>. 
1211 A quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </ENAMEX>, Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garzarelli </ENAMEX>had warned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients </ENAMEX>to take their money out of the market before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash . 
1365 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s big drop , she says , ` was not a crash . 
1412 This was an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October </TIMEX>massacre ' like those that occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1978 </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979 </TIMEX>. 
1485 Now , as in those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years </TIMEX>, her stock market indicators are positive . 
1555 So she thinks the damage will be short - lived and contained . 
1617 ` Those corrections lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one to four weeks </TIMEX>and took the market <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % - 12 % </NUMEX>down , ' she says . 
1706 ` This is exactly the same thing , as far as I ' m concerned . ' 
1765 Thus , she says , if the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2450 </NUMEX>, ` It would just be a fluke . 
1864 My advice is to buy . ' 
1888 As she calculates it , the average stock now sells for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 12 . 5 </NUMEX>times <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>' earnings . 
1980 She says that ratio could climb to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 . 5 </NUMEX>, given current interest rates , and still be within the range of ` fair value . ' 
2100 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ned Davis </ENAMEX>. 
2111 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s fall marks the start of a bear market , says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ned Davis Research Inc .  
2212 But Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis </ENAMEX>, whose views are widely respected by money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>, says he expects no <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>- style crash . 
2318 ` There was a unique combination in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, ' he says . 
2369 ` Margin debt was at a record high . 
2404 There was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds . 
2467 The main thing was portfolio insurance , ' a mechanical trading system intended to protect an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX>against losses . 
2584 ` A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred billion dollars </NUMEX>in stock was subject ' to it . 
2640 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, such selling contributed to a snowball effect . 
2698 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today </TIMEX>could even be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an up day </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis </ENAMEX>says , if major brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX>agree to refrain from program trading . 
2809 Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next several months </TIMEX>, though , he says things look bad . 
2874 ` I think the market will be heading down into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November </TIMEX>, ' he says . 
2940 ` We will probably have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - end </TIMEX>rally , and then go down again . 
3005 Sort of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>- step bear market . ' 
3038 He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2000 </NUMEX>sometime <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>. 
3144 ` That would be a normal bear market , ' he says . 
3191 ` I guess that ' s my forecast . ' 
3223 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon G . Cooperman </ENAMEX>. 
3242 ` I do n't think the market is going through another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October ' 87 </TIMEX>. 
3306 I do n't think that ' s the case at all , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cooperman </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs Asset Management </ENAMEX>. 
3449 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cooperman </ENAMEX>sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does n't think there ' s any need to rush . 
3556 ` I expect the market to open weaker <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday </TIMEX>, but then it should find some stability . ' 
3643 He ticks off several major differences between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>. 
3713 Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, interest rates have been falling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
3770 Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, the dollar has been strong . 
3811 And unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of overheating . 
3893 But the economy ' s slower growth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>also means the outlook for corporate profits ` is n't good , ' he says . 
4003 ` So it ' s a very mixed bag . ' 
4033 Thus , he concludes , ` This is not a good environment to be fully invested ' in stocks . 
4118 ` If I had come into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , I would not do any buying . 
4226 But we came into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>with a conservative portfolio , so I would look to do some modest buying ' on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients </ENAMEX>. 
4345 ` We ' re going to look for some of the better - known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>that got clocked ' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
4433 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kenneth Galbraith </ENAMEX>. 
4457 ` This is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insanity </ENAMEX>, ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galbraith </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX>. 
4595 ` I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , ' he says . 
4665 ` The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>and loaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity . 
4902 This has both made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>uneasy and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>more vulnerable . ' 
4979 Nevertheless , he says a depression does n't appear likely . 
5037 ` There is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose , ' he says . 
5123 ` It takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thirties </TIMEX>- - much as the financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community </ENAMEX>and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government </ENAMEX>may try . ' 
5267 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Gabelli </ENAMEX>. 
5282 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Gabelli </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert </ENAMEX>at spotting takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">candidates </ENAMEX>, says that takeovers are n't totally gone . 
5406 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies </ENAMEX>are still going to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>around the world , ' he says . 
5478 Examples are ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford </ENAMEX>looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth </ENAMEX>looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN Broadcasting </ENAMEX>. ' 
5556 These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabelli </ENAMEX>figures they will continue . 
5686 ` The market was up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 % </NUMEX>since -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX>-RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>took office , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabelli </ENAMEX>says , so a correction was to be expected . 
5800 He thinks another crash is ` unlikely , ' and says he was ` nibbling at ' selected stocks during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge . 
5911 ` Stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity -LCB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this -RCB- week </TIMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys </ENAMEX>like me , ' he says . 
6033 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Rogers </ENAMEX>. 
6045 ` It seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor </ENAMEX>of finance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Columbia University </ENAMEX>and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co - manager </ENAMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of the most successful hedge funds in history , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Quantum Fund </ENAMEX>. 
6276 He sees ` economic problems , financial problems ' ahead for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>, with a fairly strong possibility of a recession . 
6393 ` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>you could n't sell dollars , ' he says . 
6438 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers </ENAMEX>` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . ' 
6507 If the dollar stays weak , he says , that will add to inflationary pressures in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>and make it hard for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board </ENAMEX>to ease interest rates very much . 
6677 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers </ENAMEX>wo n't decide what to do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>until he sees how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo </ENAMEX>markets go . 
6769 He recommends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>sell takeover - related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks - - especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness . 
6945 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Curzio </ENAMEX>. 
6959 Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>now claim to have predicted the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash . 
7015 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Queens </ENAMEX>newsletter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis X . Curzio </ENAMEX>actually did it : He stated in writing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1987 </TIMEX>that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was likely to decline <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 500 </NUMEX>points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the following month </TIMEX>. 
7214 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curzio </ENAMEX>says what happens now will depend a good deal on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board </ENAMEX>. 
7301 If it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>, he says , ` That could quiet things down . ' 
7410 If not , ` We could go to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2200 </NUMEX>very soon . ' 
7453 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank W . Terrizzi </ENAMEX>. 
7472 Stock prices ` would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrizzi </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managing director </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance Investment Management Inc . </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cincinnati </ENAMEX>. 
7685 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance </ENAMEX>, which manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 . 8 billion </NUMEX>, drew stiff criticism from many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year </TIMEX>because it pulled entirely out of stocks at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the beginning of the year </TIMEX>and thus missed a strong rally . 
7893 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance </ENAMEX>is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents , primarily <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bills . 
7987 ` T - bills probably are the right place to be , ' he says .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers International Ltd . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Inc . </ENAMEX>, announced it will issue warrants on shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd .  
166 The move closely follows a similar offer by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon </ENAMEX>of warrants for shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp .  
280 Under the latest offer , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK $ 62 . 5 million </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US $ 8 million </NUMEX>-RRB- of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three - year </TIMEX>warrants will be issued in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>, each giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>the right to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hong Kong Telecommunications </ENAMEX>share at a price to be determined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
497 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 million </NUMEX>warrants will be priced at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK $ 1 . 25 </NUMEX>each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 26 % </NUMEX>. 
621 In trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>, the shares closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday </TIMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK $ 4 . 80 </NUMEX>each . 
713 At this price , the shares would have to rise above <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK $ 6 . 05 </NUMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon </ENAMEX>' s issue to profitably convert their warrants . 
847 While <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>have in the past issued warrants on their own shares , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon </ENAMEX>' s warrants are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>here to be issued by a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">party </ENAMEX>. 
996 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon </ENAMEX>will ` cover ' the warrants by buying sufficient shares , or options to purchase shares , to cover its entire position . 
1122 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bankers </ENAMEX>said warrants for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>stocks are attractive because they give foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>, wary of volatility in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">colony </ENAMEX>' s stock market , an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk . 
1330 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hong Kong Telecommunications </ENAMEX>warrants should be attractive to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers </ENAMEX>added , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>is one of a handful of blue - chip stocks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>market that has international appeal .

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp . </ENAMEX>said it formed a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 53 . 4 million </NUMEX>limited partnership <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>to buy land in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>suitable for residential development . 
164 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnership </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kaufman &amp; Broad Land Development Venture Limited Partnership </ENAMEX>, is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 - 50 </NUMEX>joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>with a trust created by institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">clients </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Heitman Advisory Corp . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Heitman Financial Corp . </ENAMEX>, a real estate advisory , management and development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .  
485 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kaufman &amp; Broad </ENAMEX>, a home building <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, declined to identify the institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">investors </ENAMEX>. 
579 The land to be purchased by the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development , and part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kaufman &amp; Broad </ENAMEX>' s job will be to obtain such approvals . 
768 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnership </ENAMEX>runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Karatz </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kaufman &amp; Broad </ENAMEX>. 
1036 ` There are really very few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash . 
1143 Typically , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers </ENAMEX>option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karatz </ENAMEX>, adding that he believes the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>of its kind . 
1334 ` We usually operate in that conservative manner . ' 
1386 By setting up the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kaufman &amp; Broad </ENAMEX>can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land , while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karatz </ENAMEX>said . 
1572 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>is putting up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10 % </NUMEX>of the capital , although it is responsible for providing management , planning and processing services to the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>. 
1733 ` This is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of the best ways to assure a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">pipeline </ENAMEX>of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karatz </ENAMEX>said .  

9 Amid a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd </ENAMEX>of crashing stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Relational Technology Inc . </ENAMEX>' s stock fell particularly hard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, dropping <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 % </NUMEX>because its problems were compounded by disclosure of an unexpected loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its fiscal first quarter </TIMEX>. 
227 The database software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said it expects a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 million </NUMEX>net loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal first quarter ended Sept . 30 </TIMEX>. 
340 It said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>had been expecting a small profit for the period . 
407 Revenue is expected to be ` up modestly ' from the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26 . 5 million </NUMEX>reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago </TIMEX>. 
491 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Relational Technology </ENAMEX>reported net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 5 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 cents </NUMEX>a share , in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier </TIMEX>period . 
601 ` While our international operations showed strong growth , our domestic business was substantially below expectations , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Newton </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>. 
777 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">first quarter </TIMEX>is historically soft , and computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>in general are experiencing slower sales .

1070 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson </ENAMEX>' s resignation was n't related to the sales shortfall .

1296 Its high for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past year </TIMEX>was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16 . 375 </NUMEX>a share . 
1346 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous quarter </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 5 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37 cents </NUMEX>a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 47 . 2 million </NUMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keystone Consolidated Industries Inc . </ENAMEX>expects to report earnings before extraordinary tax benefits of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 . 5 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 41 cents </NUMEX>a share , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, compared with a loss <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn R . Simmons </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>. 
276 After a tax benefit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 780 , 000 </NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keystone </ENAMEX>expects to report net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 3 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 62 cents </NUMEX>a share , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons </ENAMEX>said . 
415 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third quarter last year </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keystone </ENAMEX>reported a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million </NUMEX>loss from continuing operations and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 , 000 </NUMEX>loss from discontinued operations , for a net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 2 million </NUMEX>. 
591 Revenue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest third quarter </TIMEX>was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 70 . 5 million </NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 63 . 6 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, he said . 
701 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons </ENAMEX>said the results signal a turnaround for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>of wire and wire products , which has struggled to remain competitive in the face of lower - priced , imported <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel </ENAMEX>. 
878 A new <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 46 million </NUMEX>steel rod <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">minimill </ENAMEX>, which got off to a rocky start in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1988 </TIMEX>, now is running efficiently and a new management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team </ENAMEX>is more heavily marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keystone </ENAMEX>' s products , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons </ENAMEX>said . 
1082 As a result , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>hopes to report net income for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year </TIMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 11 . 6 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 3 . 10 to $ 3 . 15 </NUMEX>a share , compared with a net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 24 . 4 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, after a loss from discontinued operations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18 . 4 million </NUMEX>. 
1317 Revenue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 </TIMEX>is expected to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 300 million </NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 21 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 247 . 3 million </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>. 
1416 For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months ended Sept . 30 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keystone </ENAMEX>expects to report net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 . 3 milion </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 . 53 </NUMEX>a share , after an extraordinary gain from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 2 million </NUMEX>in tax benefits . 
1593 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>had a net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 . 5 million </NUMEX>, including a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 . 1 million </NUMEX>loss from continuing operations and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 , 000 </NUMEX>loss from discontinued operations . 
1755 Revenue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months </TIMEX>is expected to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 230 . 5 million </NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 21 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 190 . 4 million </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>. 
1869 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keystone </ENAMEX>' s new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mill </ENAMEX>is expected to produce <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">about 585 , 000 tons </NUMEX>of steel rods <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, up from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">413 , 000 tons </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>. 
2003 Production at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mill </ENAMEX>has exceeded the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keystone </ENAMEX>' s casting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation </ENAMEX>to supply it , he said , which will force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keystone </ENAMEX>to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">billet </ENAMEX>, or unfinished steel bars , from outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>. 
2246 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keystone </ENAMEX>will have to consider expanding its casting operation , at an estimated cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million to $ 10 million </NUMEX>, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next 18 to 24 months </TIMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons </ENAMEX>said . 
2414 Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert W . Singer </ENAMEX>, who was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief operating officer </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keystone </ENAMEX>has expanded its sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force </ENAMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 15 </NUMEX>and hopes to expand its sales from the middle portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West </ENAMEX>coasts . 
2676 ` Prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keystone </ENAMEX>was an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">order - taker </ENAMEX>. 
2727 Now I think we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group </ENAMEX>of marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>who are out selling to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">wholesalers </ENAMEX>, ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons </ENAMEX>said . 
2846 Still , he said , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">the 100 - year - old </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>plans to continue its premium - priced strategy for its distinctive brand of red - tipped wire fencing and other products . 
3006 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>claims a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 % </NUMEX>share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>field fence business , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 % </NUMEX>share of poultry netting sales and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % </NUMEX>share of barbed wire sales .  

9 The market for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 billion </NUMEX>of high - risk junk bonds , battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, practically vanished <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
165 Trading ground to a halt as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>rushed to sell bonds , only to find themselves deserted by potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers </ENAMEX>. 
279 Stunned , they watched brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses </ENAMEX>mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades . 
422 ` The junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now - - there are no bids , only offers , ' says independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin D . Sass </ENAMEX>, who manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 4 billion </NUMEX>and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund . 
652 This calamity is ` far from over , ' he says . 
697 Junk ' s collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one - day </TIMEX>dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct . 19 , 1987 </TIMEX>, crash . 
863 Simultaneously , it also helped trigger <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>' s biggest rally in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>government bond market as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>rushed to move capital into the highest - quality securities they could find . 
1054 But ` an eerie silence pervaded ' the junk market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>as prices tumbled on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds </NUMEX>of high - yield bonds despite ` no active trading , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lonski </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody ' s Investors Service Inc .  
1253 For example , the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southland Corp . </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million </NUMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 3 \/ 4 % </NUMEX>bonds due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2002 </TIMEX>- - sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">less than two years ago </TIMEX>by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>- - plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just 30 cents </NUMEX>on the dollar . 
1442 But not even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman </ENAMEX>would make a market in the securities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southland </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner </ENAMEX>of the nationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">7 - 11 </ENAMEX>convenience <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores </ENAMEX>that is strapped for cash . 
1603 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>declined to comment . 
1644 Junk bonds , which mushroomed from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 2 billion </NUMEX>at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the start of this decade </TIMEX>, have been declining for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months </TIMEX>as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuer </ENAMEX>after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuer </ENAMEX>sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments . 
1834 The shaky market received its biggest jolt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month </TIMEX>from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp . </ENAMEX>, which created its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire </ENAMEX>with junk financing . 
1969 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau </ENAMEX>developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdales </ENAMEX>department - store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain </ENAMEX>up for sale . 
2134 Now , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ethan Allen </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW Services </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">York International </ENAMEX>, that are counting on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 7 billion </NUMEX>of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy - outs afloat , may never get the money . 
2383 ` The music has stopped playing , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Harkins </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal </ENAMEX>in the investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levy Harkins </ENAMEX>. 
2490 ` You ' ve either got a chair or you do n't . ' 
2534 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s aftermath , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R . Douglas Carleton </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of high - yield finance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp . </ENAMEX>, ` much of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 billion </NUMEX>forward calendar could be deferred , depending on the hysteria . ' 
2727 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston </ENAMEX>withdrew a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 475 million </NUMEX>junk offering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ohio Mattress </ENAMEX>bonds because potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>were ` very skittish . ' 
2861 The outlook ` looks shaky because we ' re still waiting ' for mutual funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Penniman </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCarthy , Crisanti &amp; Maffei </ENAMEX>, an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arm </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Xerox Financial Services </ENAMEX>. 
3158 Indeed , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody ' s </ENAMEX>index that tracks the net asset values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 </NUMEX>high - yield mutual funds declined for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the 17th consecutive day Friday </TIMEX>. 
3293 In a stark contrast , the benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 - year </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bond climbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>points , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 25 </NUMEX>for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 , 000 </NUMEX>face amount , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103 12 \/ 32 </NUMEX>, its biggest gain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year </TIMEX>. 
3468 The bond ' s yield dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 82 % </NUMEX>, the lowest since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 31 , 1987 </TIMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Technical Data Global Markets Group </ENAMEX>. 
3586 The yield on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three - month </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bills , considered the safest of all investments , plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0 . 7 </NUMEX>percentage point to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 16 % </NUMEX>, the largest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one - day </TIMEX>decline since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982 </TIMEX>. 
3758 The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 . 58 </NUMEX>- point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . 
3872 ` When you get panic in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>market , you get flight to quality in the other , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Ramirez </ENAMEX>, money market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .  
4024 Nevertheless , the problems of the junk market could prompt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve </ENAMEX>to ease credit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the months ahead </TIMEX>. 
4139 ` This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Sullivan </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of money market research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>. 
4301 Any sustained credit - easing could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities . 
4389 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dow </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner </ENAMEX>and portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lord , Abbett &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, which manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion </NUMEX>of high - yield bonds , says he does n't ` think there is any fundamental economic rationale -LCB- for the junk bond rout -RCB- . 
4595 It was herd instinct . ' 
4620 He adds : ` The junk market has witnessed some trouble and now some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>think that if the equity market gets creamed that means the economy will be terrible and that ' s bad for junk . 
4803 I do n't believe that ' s the case , but I believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>are running scared . 
4882 There is a flight to quality , and the quality is not in equities and not in junk - - it ' s in Treasurys . ' 
4988 Even as trading in high - yield issues dried up over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past month </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 2 billion </NUMEX>of new junk bonds . 
5113 For example , a recent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 375 million </NUMEX>offering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Petrolane Gas Services L . P . </ENAMEX>bonds sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston </ENAMEX>was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>times oversubscribed . 
5247 A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 550 million </NUMEX>offering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting System Inc . </ENAMEX>high - yield securities sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel </ENAMEX>was increased <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million </NUMEX>because of strong demand . 
5407 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston </ENAMEX>estimates that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December </TIMEX>alone , junk bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>will receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 . 8 billion </NUMEX>of coupon interest payments . 
5542 ` That ' s a clear indication that there is and will be an undercurrent of basic business going on , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carleton </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston </ENAMEX>. 
5677 ` I do n't know how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>can say the junk bond market disappeared when there were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 5 billion </NUMEX>of orders for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 550 million </NUMEX>of junk bonds sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner </ENAMEX>, ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Minella </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co - head </ENAMEX>of merchant banking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co .  
5913 ` When the rally comes , insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>will be leading it because they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions </NUMEX>to invest and invest they will . 
6034 There is plenty of money available from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>who want to buy well - structured deals ; it ' s the stuff that ' s financed on a shoestring that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>are wary of . ' 
6195 But such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have multiplied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, casting a pall over much of the junk market . 
6316 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael McNamara </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director </ENAMEX>of fixed - income research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper Financial Services </ENAMEX>, says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer , contributing to the slide in prices . 
6494 ` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year </TIMEX>we probably bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>out of every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>new deals , ' he says . 
6568 ` This <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year </TIMEX>, at best , it ' s in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>in every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five </NUMEX>or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six </NUMEX>. 
6623 And our credit standards have n't changed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>iota . ' 
6675 However , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNamara </ENAMEX>said the slide in junk is creating ` one hell of a buying opportunity ' for selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>. 
6791 For the moment , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>seem more preoccupied with the ` bad ' junk than the ` good ' junk . 
6881 ` The market has been weak since ' the announcement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau </ENAMEX>cash squeeze and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s subsequent bailout by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olympia &amp; York </ENAMEX>, says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minella </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch </ENAMEX>. 
7050 ` That really affected the market in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>started to ask ` What else is in trouble ? ' ' 
7144 Well before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau </ENAMEX>, though , there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its worst years </TIMEX>ever . 
7262 Despite the relatively strong economy , junk bond prices did nothing except go down , hammered by a seemingly endless trail of bad news : 
7399 - - In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June </TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two months </TIMEX>before it would default on interest payments covering some of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 2 billion </NUMEX>of speculative debt securities , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated Resources Inc . </ENAMEX>said it ran out of borrowed money . 
7611 - - In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southmark Corp . </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas </ENAMEX>- based real estate and financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 . 3 billion </NUMEX>of junk bonds , voluntarily filed for protection under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>bankruptcy law . 
7799 - - By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of July </TIMEX>, the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">seven - year </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>notes widened to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 5 . 5 </NUMEX>percentage points . 
7953 - - In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resorts International Inc . </ENAMEX>, which sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 500 million </NUMEX>of junk bonds , suspended interest payments . 
8075 - - In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>, just as the cash squeeze hit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lomas Financial Corp . </ENAMEX>defaulted on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 145 million </NUMEX>of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 2 billion </NUMEX>of debt securities . 
8274 Meantime , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of abating . 
8380 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody ' s </ENAMEX>says the frequency of corporate credit downgrades is the highest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982 </TIMEX>. 
8475 In addition , there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six </NUMEX>times as many troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>as there were in the recession of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981 </TIMEX>, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .  
8622 ` The era of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s </TIMEX>is about compound interest and the reaching for it , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Grant </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grant ' s Interest Rate Observer </ENAMEX>, an early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic </ENAMEX>of the junk bond market . 
8798 ` What we ' ve begun to see is the damage to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses </ENAMEX>of paying exorbitant compound interest . 
8891 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Businesses </ENAMEX>were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings . 
8967 What we ' re seeing now is the wrenching readjustment of asset values to a future when speculative - grade debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy . ' 
9119 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s Market Activity 
9146 Prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bonds surged in the biggest rally of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year </TIMEX>as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>fled a plummeting stock market . 
9258 The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 - year </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>bond was quoted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 p . m . EDT </TIMEX>at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103 12 \/ 32 </NUMEX>, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 27 \/ 32 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday </TIMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>points . 
9381 The yield on the benchmark fell to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 . 82 % </NUMEX>, the lowest since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 31 , 1987 </TIMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Technical Data Global Markets Group </ENAMEX>. 
9508 The ` flight to quality ' began late in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day </TIMEX>and followed a precipitous fall in the stock market . 
9607 Treasurys opened lower , reacting negatively to news that the producer price index - - a measure of inflation on the wholesale level - - accelerated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September </TIMEX>. 
9767 Bond prices barely budged until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday </TIMEX>. 
9809 Many bond market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants </ENAMEX>will be closely eying the action of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve </ENAMEX>, which might repeat its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>injection of huge amounts of liquidity to buoy the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession . 
10055 Prices of municipals , investment - grade corporates and mortgage - backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury </ENAMEX>counterparts . 
10191 Mortgage securities rose in hectic trading , with most of the activity concentrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Government National Mortgage Association </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 % </NUMEX>coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue . 
10374 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ginnie Mae </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November </TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 % </NUMEX>issue ended at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 25 \/ 32 </NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 \/ 8 </NUMEX>point on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day </TIMEX>, to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9 . 28 % </NUMEX>to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12 - year </TIMEX>average life assumption . 
10512 Investment - grade corporate bonds were up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1 \/ 2 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>point . 
10577 But the yield spread between lower - quality , investment - grade issues and higher - quality bonds widened . 
10681 And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment - grade bonds in anticipation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion </NUMEX>bond offering by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tennessee Valley Authority </ENAMEX>. 
10867 Despite rumors that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TVA </ENAMEX>' s long - awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources </ENAMEX>in the underwriting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">syndicate </ENAMEX>said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled . 
11080 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources </ENAMEX>said the smaller portions of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million </NUMEX>each of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five - year </TIMEX>and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 - year </TIMEX>bonds have already been ` substantially oversubscribed . ' 
11229 Municipal bonds rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 3 \/ 4 </NUMEX>point .

9 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Second U . S . Circuit Court of Appeals </ENAMEX>opinion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arcadian Phosphate </ENAMEX>case did not repudiate the position <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pennzoil Co . </ENAMEX>took in its dispute with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco </ENAMEX>, contrary to your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept . 8 </TIMEX>article ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Court Backs Texaco ' s View in Pennzoil Case - - Too Late </ENAMEX>. ' 
259 The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">courts </ENAMEX>will not enforce agreements to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties </ENAMEX>did not intend to be bound . 
411 In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pennzoil </ENAMEX>\/ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco </ENAMEX>litigation , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts </ENAMEX>found <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pennzoil </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Getty Oil </ENAMEX>intended to be bound ; in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arcadian Phosphates </ENAMEX>they found there was no intention to be bound . 
580 Admittedly , the principle in the cases is the same . 
632 But the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts . 
701 And the facts , as found by the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts </ENAMEX>in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>lawsuits , were different . 
788 When you suggest otherwise , you leave the realm of reporting and enter the orbit of speculation .

2304 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">consortium </ENAMEX>was put together by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoare Govett </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London </ENAMEX>- based investment banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>that is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific Corp .

3059 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>grew modestly until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>, when a majority position in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hooker Corp . </ENAMEX>was acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Herscu </ENAMEX>, currently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hooker </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>. 
3221 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herscu </ENAMEX>proceeded to launch an ambitious , but ill - fated , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion </NUMEX>acquisition binge that included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bonwit Teller </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B .

4165 ` These are n't mature assets , but they have the potential to be so , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shidler </ENAMEX>.

9 Newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publishers </ENAMEX>are reporting mixed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>results , aided by favorable newsprint prices and hampered by flat or declining advertising linage , especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast </ENAMEX>. 
194 Adding to unsteadiness in the industry , seasonal retail ad spending patterns in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>have been upset by shifts in ownership and general hardships within the retail industry . 
374 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bonwit Teller </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B . Altman &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores </ENAMEX>have filed for protection from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">creditors </ENAMEX>under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11 </ENAMEX>of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bankruptcy Code </ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">R . H . Macy &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bloomingdale </ENAMEX>' s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saks Fifth Avenue </ENAMEX>department - store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains </ENAMEX>are for sale . 
637 Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">papers </ENAMEX>throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>are also faced with a slowdown in classified - ad spending , a booming category for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years </TIMEX>. 
783 Until recently , industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>believed decreases in retail ad spending had bottomed out and would in fact increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year ' s third and fourth quarters </TIMEX>. 
944 All bets are off , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>say , because of the shifting ownership of the retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains </ENAMEX>. 
1034 ` Improved paper prices will help offset weakness in linage , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers </ENAMEX>' problems have affected the amount of ad linage they usually run , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward J . Atorino </ENAMEX>, industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc .  
1246 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Retailers </ENAMEX>are just in disarray . ' 
1282 For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gannett Co . </ENAMEX>posted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an 11 % </NUMEX>gain in net income , as total ad pages dropped at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USA Today </ENAMEX>, but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates . 
1474 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gannett </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 </NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">non - daily </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 % </NUMEX>increase in advertising and circulation revenue . 
1584 Total advertising linage was ` modestly ' lower as classified - ad volume increased , while there was ` softer demand ' for retail and national ad linage , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Curley </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gannett </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>. 
1787 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USA Today </ENAMEX>, ad pages totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">785 </NUMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 . 2 % </NUMEX>from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>period , which was helped by increased ad spending from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Summer Olympics </ENAMEX>. 
1939 While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USA Today </ENAMEX>' s total paid ad pages for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year to date </TIMEX>totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 , 735 </NUMEX>, a decrease of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper </ENAMEX>' s ad revenue increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter </TIMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months </TIMEX>. 
2125 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gannett </ENAMEX>' s net rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 . 5 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 270 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 68 </NUMEX>a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 247 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 52 </NUMEX>a share . 
2241 Revenue gained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 55 billion </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 4 billion </NUMEX>. 
2297 At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones &amp; Co . </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - quarter </TIMEX>net income fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 . 9 % </NUMEX>from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier </TIMEX>period . 
2382 Net fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28 . 8 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">29 cents </NUMEX>a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 32 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33 cents </NUMEX>a share . 
2469 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier </TIMEX>period included a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>- time gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 . 5 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four cents </NUMEX>a share . 
2558 Revenue gained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 . 3 % </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 404 . 1 million </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 383 . 8 million </NUMEX>. 
2619 The drop in profit reflected , in part , continued softness in financial advertising at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barron ' s </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>. 
2752 Ad linage at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal </ENAMEX>fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 . 1 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>. 
2811 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Affiliated Publications Inc . </ENAMEX>reversed a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier third quarter </TIMEX>net loss . 
2888 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publisher </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Globe </ENAMEX>reported net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 . 5 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 cents </NUMEX>a share , compared with a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26 . 5 million </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">38 cents </NUMEX>a share , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter in 1988 </TIMEX>. 
3066 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William O . Taylor </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>, said earnings continued to be hurt by softness in ad volume at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper </ENAMEX>. 
3223 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Third - quarter </TIMEX>profit estimates for several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>are being strongly affected by the price of newsprint , which in the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years </TIMEX>has had several price increases . 
3392 After a supply crunch caused prices to rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 % </NUMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 650 </NUMEX>a metric ton , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>are encouraged , because they do n't expect a price increase for the rest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
3570 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies </ENAMEX>with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast </ENAMEX>will need the stable newsprint prices to ease damage from weak ad linage . 
3693 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atorino </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers </ENAMEX>said he estimates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Times Mirror Co . </ENAMEX>' s earnings were down for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>, because of soft advertising levels at its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Long Island Newsday </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hartford Courant </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>. 
3905 Trouble on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Coast </ENAMEX>was likely offset by improved ad linage at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Los Angeles Times </ENAMEX>, which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>also unveiled a redesign . 
4041 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times Co . </ENAMEX>is expected to report lower earnings for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times </ENAMEX>and deep discounting of newsprint at its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliate </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Forest Products Group </ENAMEX>. 
4272 ` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Times Co . </ENAMEX>' s regional <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>are holding up well , but there is little sign that things will improve in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>market , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Kassan </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton </ENAMEX>. 
4468 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Washington Post Co . </ENAMEX>is expected to report improved earnings , largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>area . 
4655 According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>, profits were also helped by successful cost - cutting measures at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newsweek </ENAMEX>. 
4752 The news - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">weekly </ENAMEX>has faced heightened competition from rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine </ENAMEX>and a relatively flat magazine advertising market . 
4879 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Knight - Ridder Inc . </ENAMEX>is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Detroit Free Press </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gannett </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Detroit News </ENAMEX>, and has told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>that earnings were down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter </TIMEX>. 
5104 However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts </ENAMEX>point to positive advertising spending at several of its major <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers </ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Miami Herald </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">San Jose Mercury News </ENAMEX>. 
5257 ` The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami </ENAMEX>market is coming back strong after a tough <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">couple of years </TIMEX>' when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Knight - Ridder </ENAMEX>` was starting up a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Hispanic </ENAMEX>edition and circulation was falling , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Thorp </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Provident National Bank </ENAMEX>.  

9 Population Drain Ends For Midwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">States  
57 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">IOWA </ENAMEX>IS MAKING a comeback . 
84 So are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Indiana </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan </ENAMEX>. 
119 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population </ENAMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>is on the upswing , according to new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Census Bureau </ENAMEX>estimates , following declines throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s </TIMEX>. 
263 The gains , to be sure , are rather small . 
304 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa </ENAMEX>, for instance , saw its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population </ENAMEX>grow by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 . 4 % </NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">between 1987 and 1988 </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Census Bureau </ENAMEX>says . 
422 Still , even that modest increase is good news for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state </ENAMEX>that had n't grown at all since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981 </TIMEX>. 
519 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Between 1987 and 1988 </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">North Dakota </ENAMEX>was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest </ENAMEX>to lose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population </ENAMEX>, a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>. 
633 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six </NUMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 </NUMEX>midwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>have been growing steadily since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980 </TIMEX>- - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kansas </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Dakota </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wisconsin </ENAMEX>. 
775 The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast </ENAMEX>has been holding its own in the population race . 
838 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven </NUMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>have grown <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year </TIMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980 </TIMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>, which lost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 % </NUMEX>of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population </ENAMEX>during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s </TIMEX>. 
962 And although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Massachusetts </ENAMEX>suffered slight declines earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the decade </TIMEX>, they are growing again . 
1080 At the same time , several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West </ENAMEX>have had their own population turnaround . 
1177 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>that grew in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s </TIMEX>are now losing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population </ENAMEX>- - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">West Virginia </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mississippi </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Louisiana </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oklahoma </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Montana </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wyoming </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska </ENAMEX>. 
1328 Overall , though , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West </ENAMEX>still outpace the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest </ENAMEX>, and fast - growing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states </ENAMEX>like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California </ENAMEX>ensure that the pattern will continue . 
1496 But the growth gap between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Sun Belt </ENAMEX>and other regions has clearly started narrowing . 
1587 More <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elderly </ENAMEX>Maintain Their Independence 
1632 THANKS TO modern medicine , more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples </ENAMEX>are growing old together . 
1698 And even after losing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse </ENAMEX>, more of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly </ENAMEX>are staying independent . 
1775 A new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Census Bureau </ENAMEX>study of the noninstitutionalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population </ENAMEX>shows that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">aged 65 to 74 </TIMEX>were living with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>, up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970 </TIMEX>. 
1937 This does n't mean they ' re less likely to live alone , however . 
1999 That share has remained at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 24 % </NUMEX>since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970 </TIMEX>. 
2048 What has changed is that more of the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly </ENAMEX>are living with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses </ENAMEX>rather than with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives </ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children </ENAMEX>. 
2175 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>of those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">aged 65 to 74 lived </TIMEX>with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives </ENAMEX>other than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses </ENAMEX>, down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970 </TIMEX>. 
2277 As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>get even older , many become widowed . 
2324 But even among those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">aged 75 and older </TIMEX>, the share living with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse </ENAMEX>rose slightly , to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970 </TIMEX>. 
2445 Like their younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts </ENAMEX>, the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly </ENAMEX>are less likely to live with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives </ENAMEX>. 
2542 <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 17 % </NUMEX>of those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">aged 75 and older </TIMEX>lived with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives </ENAMEX>other than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>, down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970 </TIMEX>. 
2652 The likelihood of living alone beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">the age of 75 </TIMEX>has increased to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32 % </NUMEX>. 
2735 More <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially .

2891 MANY AFFLUENT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>place personal success and money above <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family </ENAMEX>. 
2961 At least that ' s what a survey by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ernst &amp; Young </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yankelovich , Clancy , Shulman </ENAMEX>indicates . 
3052 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two - thirds </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents </ENAMEX>said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs , while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than half </NUMEX>said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families </ENAMEX>. 
3238 Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group </ENAMEX>. 
3336 Unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super - rich </ENAMEX>. 
3417 Average household income for the sample was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 194 , 000 </NUMEX>, and average net assets were reported as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 775 , 000 </NUMEX>. 
3523 The goal was to learn about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>' s fastest - growing income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups </ENAMEX>, the upper - middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class </ENAMEX>. 
3621 Although they represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population </ENAMEX>, they control <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly one - third </NUMEX>of discretionary income . 
3729 Across the board , these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers </ENAMEX>value quality , buy what they like rather than just what they need , and appreciate products that are distinctive . 
3878 Despite their considerable incomes and assets , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents </ENAMEX>in the study do n't feel financially secure , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one - fourth </NUMEX>do n't feel that they have made it . 
4042 <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Twenty percent </NUMEX>do n't even feel they are financially well off . 
4106 Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">affluent </ENAMEX>are n't comfortable with themselves , either . 
4171 <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 40 % </NUMEX>do n't feel they ' re more able than others . 
4223 While <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twothirds </NUMEX>feel some guilt about being affluent , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 25 % </NUMEX>give <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 , 500 </NUMEX>or more to charity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year </TIMEX>. 
4330 <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty - five percent </NUMEX>attend religious services regularly ; at the same time , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 % </NUMEX>feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one ' s principles . 
4479 Odds and Ends 
4495 THE NUMBER of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities </ENAMEX>who hold jobs in top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management </ENAMEX>in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>has more than doubled since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1978 </TIMEX>. 
4626 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Bankers Association </ENAMEX>says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women </ENAMEX>make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47 % </NUMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>in the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>, up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1978 </TIMEX>. 
4755 The share of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities </ENAMEX>in those positions has risen to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 % </NUMEX>. . . . 
4831 Per - capita personal income in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>grew faster than inflation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Bureau of Economic Analysis .  
4954 The amount of income divvied up for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child </ENAMEX>was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16 , 489 </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 . 6 % </NUMEX>from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 , 472 </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>. 
5067 Per capita personal income ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 , 116 </NUMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mississippi </ENAMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23 , 059 </NUMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut </ENAMEX>. . . . 
5162 There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 . 1 million </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students </ENAMEX>in college <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall </TIMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 % </NUMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Center for Education Statistics </ENAMEX>estimates . 
5289 <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 54 % </NUMEX>are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women </ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 % </NUMEX>are part - time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students </ENAMEX>.  

9 The real estate slump that ' s pushing down the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>office space and housing is also affecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city </ENAMEX>' s retail real estate market . 
156 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan </ENAMEX>, once - desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill . 
259 Retail real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers </ENAMEX>say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">tenants </ENAMEX>are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom . 
458 ` There is an unbelievable amount of space available , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faith Consolo </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Garrick - Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc .  
599 There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2 , 000 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores </ENAMEX>for rent , up from a more typical range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 200 </NUMEX>to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 , 500 </NUMEX>. 
686 ` This further confuses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers </ENAMEX>, ' she says . 
731 ` They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down ? 
802 Is this the wrong time to open a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store </ENAMEX>? 
842 Who is going to be in the space next door ? ' 
888 In addition , Ms . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consolo </ENAMEX>says , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">tenants </ENAMEX>usually can negotiate to pay rents that are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one - quarter </NUMEX>lower than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords </ENAMEX>' initial asking price . 
1035 A handful of hot retail locations , such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">57th Street </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Madison </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Fifth Avenue </ENAMEX>areas , have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents . 
1193 And , in some neighborhoods , rents have merely hit a plateau . 
1254 But on average , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan </ENAMEX>retail rents have dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % to 15 % </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past six months </TIMEX>alone , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts </ENAMEX>say . 
1360 That follows a more subtle decline in the prior <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six months </TIMEX>, after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan </ENAMEX>rents had run up rapidly since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>. 
1475 The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing . 
1550 ` As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">businesses </ENAMEX>contract or depart , the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>who might use retail services shrinks , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward A . Friedman </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helmsley Spear Inc .  
1721 He says financial problems plaguing electronics , fur and furniture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>- - key categories in the local retail economy - - have further deflated the market . 
1881 Hardest hit are what he calls ` secondary ' sites that primarily serve neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents </ENAMEX>. 
1974 In these locations , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman </ENAMEX>says , ` Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined . ' 
2130 Weakness in the restaurant industry , which is leaving retail space vacant , exacerbates the problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords </ENAMEX>. 
2246 It is also no comfort to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords </ENAMEX>and small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers </ENAMEX>when the future of larger department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores </ENAMEX>, which anchor retail neighborhoods , are in doubt . 
2404 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hooker Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bonwit Teller </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B . Altman ' s </ENAMEX>, is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bloomingdale ' s </ENAMEX>is for sale by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp .  
2555 The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>are bemoaning the loss of favorite local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses </ENAMEX>to high rents . 
2711 But , despite the recent softening , for many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers </ENAMEX>there ' s still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1970s </TIMEX>, when their leases were signed . 
2882 Certainly , the recent drop in prices does n't mean <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan </ENAMEX>comes cheap . 
2955 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>retail rents still run well above the going rate in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities </ENAMEX>. 
3035 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Madison </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Fifth Avenues </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">East 57th Street </ENAMEX>can command rents of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 500 </NUMEX>a square foot , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 </NUMEX>is not uncommon . 
3155 The thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">34th Street </ENAMEX>area offers rents of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 100 </NUMEX>a square foot , as do up - and - coming locations along lower <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Fifth Avenue </ENAMEX>. 
3283 By contrast , rentals in the best retail locations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>rarely top <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 </NUMEX>a square foot . 
3401 And rents on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills </ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Rodeo Drive </ENAMEX>generally do n't exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 125 </NUMEX>a square foot . 
3501 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>securities will begin trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week </TIMEX>.

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel Inc . </ENAMEX>expects <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal second - quarter </TIMEX>earnings to trail <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 </TIMEX>results , but anticipates that several new products will lead to a ` much stronger ' performance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its second half </TIMEX>. 
191 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel </ENAMEX>, a telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>, had net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 272 , 000 </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five cents </NUMEX>a share , in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - earlier second quarter , ended Sept . 30 </TIMEX>. 
333 Revenue totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million </NUMEX>. 
361 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Pierce </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>, said in an interview that earnings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the most recent quarter </TIMEX>will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about two cents </NUMEX>a share on revenue of just under <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 million </NUMEX>. 
547 The lower results , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce </ENAMEX>said , reflect a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12 - month </TIMEX>decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel </ENAMEX>' s primary business . 
691 Although Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce </ENAMEX>expects that line of business to strengthen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next year </TIMEX>, he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel </ENAMEX>will also benefit from moving into other areas . 
839 Foremost among those is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s entrance into the public facsimile business , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce </ENAMEX>said . 
939 Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next year </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel </ENAMEX>expects to place <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 , 000 </NUMEX>fax machines , made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Minolta </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotels </ENAMEX>, municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">drugstores </ENAMEX>and other public settings around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>. 
1122 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel </ENAMEX>will provide a credit - card reader for the machines to collect , store and forward billing data . 
1227 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel </ENAMEX>should realize a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 </NUMEX>of recurring net earnings for each machine each month . 
1340 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel </ENAMEX>has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s system for automating and handling credit - card calls and collect calls . 
1511 Automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce </ENAMEX>said , not just phones produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel </ENAMEX>. 
1647 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones , which do n't accept coins , for use in hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lobbies </ENAMEX>, office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lobbies </ENAMEX>, hospitality <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lounges </ENAMEX>and similar settings . 
1832 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce </ENAMEX>estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 5 </NUMEX>of recurring net earnings for each machine each month .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Information International Inc . </ENAMEX>said it was sued by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer </ENAMEX>of its computerized newspaper - publishing system , alleging that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>failed to correct deficiencies in the system . 
191 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Information International </ENAMEX>said the lawsuit by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morris Communications Corp . </ENAMEX>seeks restitution of the system ' s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 3 million </NUMEX>purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morris </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units </ENAMEX>to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Information International </ENAMEX>for alleged failure to pay royalties . 
497 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Information International </ENAMEX>said it believes that the complaints , filed in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Georgia </ENAMEX>, are without merit . 
615 Closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morris Communications </ENAMEX>is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Augusta </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ga .  
675 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units </ENAMEX>that filed the suit are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southeastern Newspapers Corp . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Florida Publishing Co .   

9 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>' s decision to approve a bare - bones deficit - reduction bill without a capital - gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
191 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Late Friday </TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>voted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87 - 7 </NUMEX>to approve <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 13 . 5 billion </NUMEX>measure that had been stripped of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds </NUMEX>of provisions that would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit . 
402 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawmakers </ENAMEX>drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special - interest tax breaks and spending increases . 
543 ` We ' re putting a deficit - reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit - reduction bill , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Budget Committee </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sasser </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tenn . </ENAMEX>-RRB- . 
706 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters </ENAMEX>of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital - gains tax cut . 
914 In addition , the companion deficit - reduction bill already passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>includes a capital - gains provision . 
1028 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>negotiations are likely to begin at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">midweek </TIMEX>and last for a while . 
1109 ` No one can predict exactly what will happen on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>side , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>Minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leader </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dole </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kan . </ENAMEX>-RRB- . 
1226 But , he added , ` I believe <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats </ENAMEX>will work together to get capital - gains reform <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. ' 
1339 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House </ENAMEX>Budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman </ENAMEX>told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday </TIMEX>that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>would n't push to keep the capital - gains cut in the final version of the bill . 
1509 ` We do n't need this as a way to get capital gains , ' he said . 
1572 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Budget Committee </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Panetta </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>-RRB- said in an interview , ` If that ' s the signal that comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House </ENAMEX>, that will help a great deal . ' 
1739 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>' s decision was a setback for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>and will make approval of a capital - gains tax cut less certain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. 
1868 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Opponents </ENAMEX>of the cut are playing hardball . 
1911 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>Majority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leader </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine </ENAMEX>-RRB- said he was ` confident ' that any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>agreement on the deficit - reduction legislation would n't include a capital - gains tax cut . 
2097 And a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide </ENAMEX>to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Ways and Means Committee </ENAMEX>, where tax legislation originates , said there are n't any ` plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>. ' 
2292 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>obvious place to attach a capital - gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit - reduction bill , is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit . 
2476 Such legislation must be enacted by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the month </TIMEX>. 
2536 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit - reduction through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress </ENAMEX>. 
2626 Because the legislation has n't been completed , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>has until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight tonight </TIMEX>to enact across - the - board spending cuts mandated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm - Rudman </ENAMEX>deficit - reduction law . 
2809 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senators </ENAMEX>hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>to agree to the streamlined bill . 
2915 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>appears reluctant to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators </ENAMEX>. 
2965 A key is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans </ENAMEX>are willing to acquiesce to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues </ENAMEX>' decision to drop many pet provisions . 
3093 ` Although I am encouraged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>action , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Rostenkowski </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill . </ENAMEX>-RRB- of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Ways and Means Committee </ENAMEX>, ` it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>. ' 
3324 Another big question hovering over the debate is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX>thinks . 
3401 He has been resisting a stripped - down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital - gains tax cut . 
3500 But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators </ENAMEX>saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 </NUMEX>votes needed to win the capital - gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the streamlined bill . 
3691 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue - losing , provisions , a number of which are included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>- passed bill . 
3829 These include a child - care initiative and extensions of soon - to - expire tax breaks for low - income housing and research - and - development expenditures . 
3977 Also missing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>bill is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>' s repeal of a law , called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 89 </ENAMEX>, that compels <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>to give rank - and - file <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>comparable health benefits to top paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives </ENAMEX>. 
4168 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One </NUMEX>high - profile provision that was originally in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas </ENAMEX>-RRB- of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Finance Committee </ENAMEX>to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts . 
4419 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen </ENAMEX>said he hopes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>will consider that measure soon . 
4491 To the delight of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors </ENAMEX>, the bill dropped a plan passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance Committee </ENAMEX>that would have overhauled the entire physician - reimbursement system under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicare </ENAMEX>. 
4664 To the detriment of many low - income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people </ENAMEX>, efforts to boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicaid </ENAMEX>funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken . 
4792 Asked why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators </ENAMEX>were giving up so much , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Mexico </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Domenici </ENAMEX>, the ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican </ENAMEX>on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Budget Committee </ENAMEX>, said , ` We ' re looking like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idiots </ENAMEX>. 
4955 Things had just gone too far . ' 
4988 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole </ENAMEX>said that the move required sacrifice by every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator </ENAMEX>. 
5054 It worked , others said , because there were no exceptions : all revenue - losing provisions were stricken . 
5159 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>also dropped a plan by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance Committee </ENAMEX>that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens </ENAMEX>have their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security </ENAMEX>benefits reduced . 
5336 In addition , the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 % </NUMEX>excise tax on long - distance telephone calls . 
5441 It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed - contract method of accounting , which is used by military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors </ENAMEX>to reduce their tax burden . 
5622 It also drops a provision that would have permitted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retirees </ENAMEX>. 
5762 Also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Occupational Safety and Health Administration </ENAMEX>penalties , which would have raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 65 million </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990 </TIMEX>. 
5924 A provision that would have made the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security Administration </ENAMEX>an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency </ENAMEX>was excised . 
6029 The approval of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate </ENAMEX>bill was especially sweet for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell </ENAMEX>, who had proposed the streamlining . 
6136 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell </ENAMEX>' s relations with Budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman </ENAMEX>, who pushed for a capital - gains cut to be added to the measure , have been strained since Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman </ENAMEX>chose to bypass the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat </ENAMEX>and deal with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year </TIMEX>during a dispute over drug funding in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989 </TIMEX>supplemental spending bill . 
6456 The deficit reduction bill contains <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 3 billion </NUMEX>in tax increases in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990 </TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26 billion </NUMEX>over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years </TIMEX>. 
6571 The revenue - raising provisions , which affect mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations </ENAMEX>, would : 
6646 - - Prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>that have made leveraged buy - outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy - outs , effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug . 2 , 1989 </TIMEX>. 
6850 - - Require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the date </TIMEX>that the dividends are declared rather than received , effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day </TIMEX>after the tax bill is enacted . 
7049 - - Close a loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans , effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 6 , 1989 </TIMEX>, that has been exploited by investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bankers </ENAMEX>in corporate takeovers . 
7205 The measure repeals a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % </NUMEX>exclusion given to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks </ENAMEX>on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP , if the ESOP owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 30 % </NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employer </ENAMEX>' s stock . 
7381 - - Curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities , such as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero </NUMEX>- coupon bonds , that postpone cash interest payments . 
7514 - - Raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 851 million </NUMEX>by suspending for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one year </TIMEX>an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes . 
7617 - - Speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>, effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 1990 </TIMEX>. 
7710 - - Impose a tax on ozone - depleting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals </ENAMEX>, such as those used in air conditioners and in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Styrofoam </ENAMEX>, beginning at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 10 </NUMEX>a pound starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>. 
7862 - - Withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers </ENAMEX>currently exempt from withholding . 
7967 - - Change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly </TIMEX>from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">semimonthly </TIMEX>, effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>. 
8068 - - Restrict the ability of real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners </ENAMEX>to escape taxes by swapping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash . 
8210 - - Increase to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 </NUMEX>a person from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 </NUMEX>the international air - passenger departure tax , and impose a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 </NUMEX>- a - person tax on international departures by commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships </ENAMEX>. 
8372 The measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees . 
8443 Among its provisions : 
8467 - - Reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicare </ENAMEX>spending in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990 </TIMEX>by some <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 8 billion </NUMEX>, in part by curbing increases in reimbursements to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians </ENAMEX>. 
8600 The plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year </TIMEX>. 
8668 - - Removal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . S . Postal Service </ENAMEX>' s operating budget from the federal budget , reducing the deficit by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 77 billion </NUMEX>. 
8789 A similar provision is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House </ENAMEX>version . 
8836 - - Authority for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Aviation Administration </ENAMEX>to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 239 million </NUMEX>by charging fees for commercial airline - landing rights at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">LaGuardia </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">John F . Kennedy International Airports </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">O ' Hare International Airport </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">National Airport </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington </ENAMEX>.

9 Pension funds , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers </ENAMEX>and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">behemoths </ENAMEX>of the investing world said they began scooping up stocks during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s market rout . 
140 And they plan to buy more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. 
175 Rightly or wrongly , many giant institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987 </TIMEX>crash : Buying at the bottom pays off . 
363 To be sure , big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today </TIMEX>. 
468 They could still panic and bail out of the market . 
519 But their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse . 
622 ` Last time , we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John W . Rogers </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ariel Capital Management Inc . </ENAMEX>, which manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 . 1 billion </NUMEX>of stocks . 
832 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers </ENAMEX>spent half his cash on hand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>for ` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart . ' 
928 He expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further . 
991 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver </ENAMEX>- based portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Craig </ENAMEX>was n't daunted when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s rout shaved <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million </NUMEX>from the value of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 752 million </NUMEX>Janus Fund he oversees . 
1146 ` I waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through , ' he said . 
1222 Then he jumped into the market : 
1254 ` I spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million </NUMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last half - hour </TIMEX>. ' 
1301 Other money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>also opened their wallets . 
1349 ` I was buying at the close -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>-RRB- and I ' ll be buying again because I know we ' re getting good value , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick A . Moran </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moran Asset Management Inc . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Greenwich </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn .  
1536 ` There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash . ' 
1607 Unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell stockholdings when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>rush to withdraw money , big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>such as pension funds and insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock . 
1833 Most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be the best - performing long - term investment , attracting <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 trillion </NUMEX>from pension funds alone . 
1996 ` If you bought after the crash , you did very very well off the bottom , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen B . Timbers </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief investment officer </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper Financial Services Inc .  
2166 The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56 billion </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">California Public Employees Retirement System </ENAMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>, added <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion </NUMEX>to its stock portfolio <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago </TIMEX>. 
2295 ` The last crash taught institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>that they have to be long - term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">holders </ENAMEX>, and that they ca n't react to short - term events , good or bad , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen L . Nesbitt </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president </ENAMEX>for the pension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consultants </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wilshire Associates </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Monica </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .  
2563 ` Those that pulled out -LRB- of stocks -RRB- regretted it , ' he said , ` so I doubt you ' ll see any significant changes ' in institutional portfolios as a result of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s decline . 
2733 Stocks , as measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor </ENAMEX>' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 </NUMEX>- stock index , have been stellar performers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>, rising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 . 97 % </NUMEX>before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s plunge , excluding dividends . 
2894 Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s slump leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>ahead <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 % </NUMEX>, well above the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>average for stocks over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several decades </TIMEX>. 
3017 ` You could go down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400 </NUMEX>points and still have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a good year </TIMEX>in the market , ' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James D . Awad </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BMI Capital Corp .  
3158 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Awad </ENAMEX>, however , worries that the market ` could go down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800 </NUMEX>or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900 </NUMEX>points in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few days </TIMEX>. 
3256 It can happen before you can turn around . ' 
3299 He said he discerns many parallels with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>, including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re - emergence of computerized program trading . 
3441 ` The only thing you do n't have , ' he said , ` is the ` portfolio insurance ' phenomenon overlaid on the rest . ' 
3549 Most institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors </ENAMEX>have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique , which is widely thought to have worsened the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash . 
3693 Not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S &amp; P </ENAMEX>futures contracts . 
3862 In its severest test , the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60 billion </NUMEX>of portfolio insurance in effect in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>crash did n't work , as stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers </ENAMEX>disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected . 
4044 Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>said . 
4135 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Weisman </ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chilmark Capital Partners </ENAMEX>had converted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 % </NUMEX>of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 220 million </NUMEX>investment pool to cash in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months </TIMEX>, said he was besieged by Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>asking him to take stock off their hands . 
4369 ` We got calls from big block <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses </ENAMEX>asking us if we want to make bids on anything , ' said Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisman </ENAMEX>, who , happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier , declined the offers . 
4557 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisman </ENAMEX>predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few days </TIMEX>before declining again , trapping more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors </ENAMEX>. 
4680 ` I think it will be a rigor mortis rally , ' he said . 
4732 Meanwhile , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>brought a reprieve for money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers </ENAMEX>whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally . 
4856 Especially gleeful were the short <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers </ENAMEX>, who have been pounded by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year </TIMEX>' s market climb . 
4952 The shorts sell borrowed shares , hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price . 
5044 The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation </ENAMEX>' s largest short - selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation </ENAMEX>is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Feshbach Brothers </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Palo Alto </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif . </ENAMEX>, which said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last May </TIMEX>that its short positions had shown losses of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year </TIMEX>up to that point . 
5232 All that now has changed . 
5258 ` We ' re ahead for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year </TIMEX>because of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>, ' said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Feshbach </ENAMEX>. 
5335 ` We ' re not making a killing , but we had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a good day </TIMEX>.  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drug Emporium Inc . </ENAMEX>said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Wilber </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">39 years old </TIMEX>, who had been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief operating officer </ENAMEX>for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past year </TIMEX>, was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer </ENAMEX>of this drugstore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain </ENAMEX>. 
191 He succeeds his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip T . Wilber </ENAMEX>, who founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>and remains <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman </ENAMEX>. 
281 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert E . Lyons III </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">39 </TIMEX>, who headed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia </ENAMEX>region , was appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief operating officer </ENAMEX>, succeeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Wilber </ENAMEX>.  

9 It all seemed innocent enough : <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last April </TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven B . Iken </ENAMEX>visited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin Products Inc . </ENAMEX>here , identified himself as a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer </ENAMEX>and got the word on the little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s new cassette players for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children </ENAMEX>. 
227 ` It is almost identical to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>product , ' Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iken </ENAMEX>remarked , after seeing prototypes and pictures . 
330 Replied a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman </ENAMEX>: ` Exactly . ' 
368 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>merchandise carried wholesale prices some <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 % </NUMEX>below those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony Corp . </ENAMEX>of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">My First Sony </ENAMEX>' line . 
484 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor </ENAMEX>waxed enthusiastic and promised to return . 
541 But instead of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer </ENAMEX>- - part of a hoped - for bonanza from underselling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>- - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>got a costly legal morass . 
662 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iken </ENAMEX>, it turned out , was a private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective </ENAMEX>using a hidden tape recorder to gather information for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>. 
772 His recording later turned up as a court exhibit . 
822 Seeking to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>' s ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">My Own </ENAMEX>' product line off the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last May </TIMEX>filed a suit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan </ENAMEX>federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>accusing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">upstart </ENAMEX>of trademark infringement , unfair competition and other violations of business law . 
1051 Since then , life has changed a lot for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">61 - year - old </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Kaye </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner </ENAMEX>. 
1132 ` I have n't been able to get a decent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night </TIMEX>' s sleep since this has been going on , ' he says . 
1223 ` It ' s the most distracting thing in my life - - I ca n't even attend to my business . ' 
1307 His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>-LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>sales : <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 25 million </NUMEX>-RRB- may suffer a costly blow - - losing an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % </NUMEX>of total sales - - if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>-LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>sales : <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 16 billion </NUMEX>-RRB- prevails . 
1475 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>' s plight shows what can happen when a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrathful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">multinational </ENAMEX>. 
1600 With considerable irony , the case also shows how completely <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>has turned the tables on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX>business . 
1706 <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans </ENAMEX>used to complain bitterly about being undersold by look - alike products from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan </ENAMEX>. 
1799 Now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>, whose innovative , premium - priced products are among the most admired in consumer electronics , is bitterly complaining about a little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm </ENAMEX>with a cheap look - alike produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China </ENAMEX>. 
1997 ` The gist of this is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>knocked off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>line and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>wants to stop it , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis H . Eslinger </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney </ENAMEX>, who previously guarded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Rubik ' s Cube </ENAMEX>. 
2162 -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>itself declines to comment . -RRB- 
2197 If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>wins , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eslinger </ENAMEX>says , its little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rival </ENAMEX>will have to try to sell the products overseas . 
2295 At worst , he adds , ` They ' d have to grind them all up and throw them away . ' 
2372 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye </ENAMEX>denies the suit ' s charges and says his only mistake was taking on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>in the marketplace . 
2472 ` I made a similar line and I produced it cheaper , ' he says . 
2534 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John E . Sprizzo </ENAMEX>is expected to rule on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>' s renewed request for a pre - trial order blocking sale of the disputed products , on which deliveries began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July </TIMEX>. 
2711 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge </ENAMEX>turned down an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>request for such an order - - a decision upheld on appeal - - but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>returned with additional evidence and arguments . 
2869 Though hoping to settle the case , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>vows to fight on , if necessary . 
2942 But the battle is more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>bargained for . 
2992 ` I had no idea I was getting in so deep , ' says Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye </ENAMEX>, who founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982 </TIMEX>. 
3077 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye </ENAMEX>had sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capetronic Inc . </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Taiwan </ENAMEX>electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker </ENAMEX>, and retired , only to find he was bored . 
3180 With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>, he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>, beginning with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mickey Mouse </ENAMEX>radios . 
3293 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>has grown - - to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 40 </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees </ENAMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four </NUMEX>initially , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye </ENAMEX>says . 
3377 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>has been profitable since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986 </TIMEX>, adds the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>, who shares his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office </ENAMEX>with numerous teddy bears , all samples from his line of plush toys . 
3527 Like many others , Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye </ENAMEX>took notice in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 </TIMEX>when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>, in a classic example of market segmentation , changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Walkman </ENAMEX>line of portable audio equipment and created the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">My First Sony </ENAMEX>line for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children </ENAMEX>. 
3771 The brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models . 
3850 -LRB- In court papers , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>says it has spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 3 million </NUMEX>to promote the line , with resulting sales of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a million </NUMEX>units . -RRB- 
3982 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>found a new market niche , but Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye </ENAMEX>figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower - priced competitor . 
4101 His products are n't exact copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>' s but strongly resemble them in size , shape and , especially , color . 
4210 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>uses mostly red and blue , with traces of yellow - - and so does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>, on the theory that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids </ENAMEX>prefer these colors . 
4331 -LRB- ` To be successful , a product can be any color whatsoever , as long as it is fire - engine red , ' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles E . Baxley </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney </ENAMEX>. -RRB- 
4471 By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last winter </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>was showing prototypes at toy fairs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York </ENAMEX>- - and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>noticed . 
4577 Indeed , concerned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel </ENAMEX>were threatening legal action or other retaliation - - such as withholding desirable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>products - - against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baxley </ENAMEX>fired off a letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April </TIMEX>. 
4798 He himself threatened to take the matter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Trade Commission </ENAMEX>or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U . S . Justice Department </ENAMEX>. 
4899 But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>has n't pursued those charges -LRB- which were without merit , according to Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eslinger </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney </ENAMEX>-RRB- . 
5013 Recalls Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baxley </ENAMEX>: ` Our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone . 
5087 We never intended taking on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>- - we do n't have the resources . ' 
5155 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>answered the empty threat with its real suit . 
5206 Off and on since then , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>have skirmished in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>. 
5269 And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>, in a news release , says , ` Once competitive , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>now resorts to strong - arm tactics in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">courtrooms </ENAMEX>to carve out and protect niche markets . ' 
5430 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer </ENAMEX>insists that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>' s tactics - - including the use of a private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective </ENAMEX>posing as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer </ENAMEX>- - are routine in such matters . 
5573 He also insists that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>, no less than others , has a legal right to protect its ` trade dress , ' in this case , mostly the colors that it claims make <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">My First Sony </ENAMEX>products distinctive . 
5757 -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children </ENAMEX>long before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children </ENAMEX>' s market . -RRB- 
5887 Whatever its merits , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>' s aggressive defense is debilitating for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin </ENAMEX>. 
5962 It ' s also costly . 
5980 Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye </ENAMEX>says he has paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 70 , 000 </NUMEX>in legal fees so far . 
6048 Of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony </ENAMEX>, Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye </ENAMEX>says : ` They know there ' s no way for them to lose . 
6116 They just keep digging me in deeper until I reach the point where I give up and go away . ' 
6206 For now , though , he vows to hang in .  

9 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>, urging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court </ENAMEX>to give states more leeway to restrict abortions , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minors </ENAMEX>have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents </ENAMEX>. 
191 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Solicitor General </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr </ENAMEX>argued that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973 </TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court </ENAMEX>decision , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe </ENAMEX>vs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade </ENAMEX>, recognizing a constitutional right to abortion , was incorrect . 
345 He also argued that the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>was wrong in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976 </TIMEX>to rule that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minors </ENAMEX>have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents </ENAMEX>. 
495 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>' s position was outlined in a friend - of - the - court brief filed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one </NUMEX>of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three </NUMEX>abortion cases the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court </ENAMEX>will hear argued and will decide this term . 
668 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>filed the brief in an appeal involving a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota </ENAMEX>law that requires that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents </ENAMEX>of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minor </ENAMEX>be notified before she may have an abortion . 
832 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices </ENAMEX>to adopt a legal standard suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Rehnquist </ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last July </TIMEX>when the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>upheld <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri </ENAMEX>' s abortion restrictions . 
1012 Under that standard , which garnered the votes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three </NUMEX>of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices </ENAMEX>, a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state </ENAMEX>has a ` reasonable ' justification for adopting it . 
1207 That is a much easier standard for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state </ENAMEX>to satisfy than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court </ENAMEX>' s test since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973 </TIMEX>, which requires a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state </ENAMEX>to have a ` compelling ' reason for restricting abortion . 
1384 On the provisions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota </ENAMEX>law , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration </ENAMEX>said that requiring that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents </ENAMEX>be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minors </ENAMEX>to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court </ENAMEX>for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge </ENAMEX>' s permission instead . 
1645 The case , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodgson </ENAMEX>vs . <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota </ENAMEX>, will be argued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov . 29 </TIMEX>.  

9 Plunge ? 
17 What plunge ? 
32 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty - four </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange </ENAMEX>issues hit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">52 - week </TIMEX>highs during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s trading , despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average ' s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 . 58 </NUMEX>- point plunge . 
184 Stocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities </ENAMEX>held up relatively better than other market sectors during the sell - off . 
277 And among the issues hitting new highs were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Detroit Edison Co . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Niagara Mohawk Power Corp .  
371 Other major issues hitting highs included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse Electric Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon Corp . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cigna Corp . </ENAMEX>, the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer </ENAMEX>. 
526 Of course , many more issues - - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93 </NUMEX>- - hit new lows . 
577 These included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp . </ENAMEX>, which during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>' s session traded below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 </NUMEX>a share for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>time since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1984 </TIMEX>. 
723 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM </ENAMEX>closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 102 </NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 . 625 </NUMEX>. 
756 Other new lows included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navistar International Corp . </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Carbide Corp . </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem Steel Corp . </ENAMEX>, all of which are included in the industrial average . 
912 Meanwhile , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>initial public offerings braved the cascading market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">their maiden day </TIMEX>of national over - the - counter trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday </TIMEX>. 
1045 Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rally ' s Inc . </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator </ENAMEX>of fast - food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants </ENAMEX>, closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 </NUMEX>each , up from its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 </NUMEX>offering price and shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Employee Benefit Plans Inc . </ENAMEX>, a health - care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consultant </ENAMEX>, closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14 . 125 </NUMEX>, up from its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 </NUMEX>offering price .  

9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace PLC </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson - CSF S . A . </ENAMEX>said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided - missile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions </ENAMEX>, greatly expanding collaboration between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX>defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors </ENAMEX>. 
208 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 - 50 </NUMEX>joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>, which may be dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurodynamics </ENAMEX>, would have combined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least # 1 . 4 billion </NUMEX>-LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 . 17 billion </NUMEX>-RRB- and would be among the world ' s largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">missile </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers </ENAMEX>. 
396 After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years </TIMEX>of talks , plans for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>are sufficiently advanced for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>to seek <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>government clearance . 
537 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>hope for a final agreement by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year - end </TIMEX>. 
593 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>, and help make them a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX>defense contracting . 
742 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months </TIMEX>, a string of cross - border <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">mergers </ENAMEX>and joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures </ENAMEX>have reshaped the once - balkanized world of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">arms </ENAMEX>manufacture . 
884 Already , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French </ENAMEX>government - controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Thomson - CSF </ENAMEX>collaborate on a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>missile contract and on an air - traffic control radar system . 
1042 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just last week </TIMEX>they announced they may make a joint bid to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti International Signal PLC </ENAMEX>, a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractor </ENAMEX>rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>. 
1230 The sudden romance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Thomson - CSF </ENAMEX>- - traditionally bitter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Middle East </ENAMEX>and Third World weapons contracts - - is stirring controversy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Western Europe </ENAMEX>' s defense industry . 
1437 Most threatened by closer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace - Thomson </ENAMEX>ties would be their respective national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals </ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matra S . A . </ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co . PLC </ENAMEX>. 
1608 But neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matra </ENAMEX>nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC </ENAMEX>- - unrelated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stamford </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn . </ENAMEX>- based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co . </ENAMEX>- - are sitting quietly by as their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors </ENAMEX>join forces . 
1755 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday </TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source </ENAMEX>close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC </ENAMEX>confirmed that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company </ENAMEX>may join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti </ENAMEX>fight , as part of a possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">consortium </ENAMEX>that would bid against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Thomson - CSF </ENAMEX>. 
1935 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies </ENAMEX>with which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC </ENAMEX>has had talks about a possible joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti </ENAMEX>bid include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matra </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dowty Group PLC </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daimler - Benz AG </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dassault </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group </ENAMEX>. 
2115 But it may be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks </TIMEX>before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC </ENAMEX>and its potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partners </ENAMEX>decide whether to bid , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source </ENAMEX>indicated . 
2218 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC </ENAMEX>plans <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first </NUMEX>to study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti </ENAMEX>' s financial accounts , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">auditors </ENAMEX>recently said included <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 215 million </NUMEX>in fictitious contracts at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U . S . </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Signal &amp; Control Group </ENAMEX>, with which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti </ENAMEX>merged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year </TIMEX>. 
2441 Also , any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC </ENAMEX>bid might be blocked by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British </ENAMEX>antitrust <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators </ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti </ENAMEX>is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC </ENAMEX>' s main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor </ENAMEX>on several key defense - electronics contracts , and its purchase by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC </ENAMEX>may heighten <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">British Defense Ministry </ENAMEX>worries about concentration in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country </ENAMEX>' s defense industry . 
2714 A consortium bid , however , would diminish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC </ENAMEX>' s direct role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti </ENAMEX>and might consequently appease ministry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>. 
2839 A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman </ENAMEX>appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC </ENAMEX>for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti </ENAMEX>: ` Competition is the name of the game , ' she said . 
2993 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least one </NUMEX>potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matra </ENAMEX>, insists it is n't interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti </ENAMEX>. 
3077 ` We have nothing to say about this affair , which does n't concern us , ' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matra </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official </ENAMEX>said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday </TIMEX>. 
3179 The missile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman </ENAMEX>said , is a needed response to the ` new environment ' in defense contracting . 
3310 For both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson </ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace </ENAMEX>, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight - fisted defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministries </ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Middle East </ENAMEX>sales , a traditional mainstay for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies </ENAMEX>' exports , have been hurt by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years </TIMEX>of weak oil prices . 
3583 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>' s importance for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson </ENAMEX>is great . 
3630 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson </ENAMEX>feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Europeans </ENAMEX>. 
3733 The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European </ENAMEX>defense industry is consolidating ; for instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Siemens AG </ENAMEX>recently joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC </ENAMEX>in a takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Plessey Co . </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daimler - Benz </ENAMEX>agreed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Messerschmitt - Boelkow Blohm G . m . b . H </ENAMEX>. 
3952 In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">missiles </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson </ENAMEX>is already overshadowed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace </ENAMEX>and by its home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rival </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France </ENAMEX>' s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aerospatiale S . A . </ENAMEX>; to better compete , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials </ENAMEX>say , they need a partnership . 
4136 To justify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 - 50 </NUMEX>ownership of the planned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson </ENAMEX>would make a cash payment to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace </ENAMEX>.

4458 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson </ENAMEX>missile products , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half </NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace </ENAMEX>' s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual </TIMEX>revenue , include the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">Crotale </ENAMEX>surface - to - air missile family .

539 The releases , announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week </TIMEX>by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President </ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Klerk </ENAMEX>, were viewed as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pretoria </ENAMEX>' s tacit legalization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>. 
655 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandela </ENAMEX>, considered the most prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader </ENAMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC </ENAMEX>, remains in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison </ENAMEX>.
